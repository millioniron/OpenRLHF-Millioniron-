Suppose, if possible, that no $t_{i}$ is isolated from the other $t_{j}$ by an open subinterval of $(0,1)$ whose length is greater than or equal to $\\lambda$. Without loss of generality, we may (and will) assume that $0=t_{0}<t_{1}<\\cdots<t_{k}<t_{k+1}=1$. Since the open interval $\\left(t_{i-1}, t_{i+1}\\right)$ isolates $t_{i}$ from the other $t_{j}$, its length, $t_{i+1}-t_{i-1}$, is less than $\\lambda$. Consequently, if $k$ is odd we have $1=\\sum_{i=0}^{(k-1) / 2}\\left(t_{2 i+2}-t_{2 i}\\right)<\\lambda\\left(1+\\frac{k-1}{2}\\right)<1$; if $k$ is even, we have $1<1+t_{k}-t_{k-1}=$ $\\sum_{i=0}^{k / 2-1}\\left(t_{2 i+2}-t_{2 i}\\right)+\\left(t_{k+1}-t_{k-1}\\right)<\\lambda\\left(1+\\frac{k}{2}\\right)<1$. A contradiction in either case.\n\n\n\nProof of Lemma 2. Let $I_{0}$, respectively $I_{1}$, be the set of all indices $i$ in the range $2, \\ldots, k-1$ such that $m_{i}$ is even, respectively odd. Clearly, $I_{0}$ and $I_{1}$ form a partition of that range. Since $m_{i} \\geq 2$ if $i$ is in $I_{0}$, and $m_{i} \\geq 1$ if $i$ is in $I_{1}$ (recall that the $m_{i}$ are positive integers),\n\n\n\n$$\n\n\\sum_{i=2}^{k-1} m_{i}=\\sum_{i \\in I_{0}} m_{i}+\\sum_{i \\in I_{1}} m_{i} \\geq 2\\left|I_{0}\\right|+\\left|I_{1}\\right|=2(k-2)-\\left|I_{1}\\right|, \\quad \\text { or } \\quad\\left|I_{1}\\right| \\geq 2(k-2)-\\sum_{i=2}^{k-1} m_{i}\n\n$$\n\n\n\nTherefore,\n\n\n\n$$\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n\n\\left\\lfloor\\frac{m_{1}}{2}\\right\\rfloor+\\sum_{i=1}^{k}\\left\\lfloor\\frac{m_{i}}{2}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor\\frac{m_{k}}{2}\\right\\rfloor & \\leq m_{1}+\\left(\\sum_{i=2}^{k-1} \\frac{m_{i}}{2}-\\frac{\\left|I_{1}\\right|}{2}\\right)+m_{k} \\\\\n\n& \\leq m_{1}+\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=2}^{k-1} m_{i}-(k-2)+\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=2}^{k-1} m_{i}\\right)+m_{k} \\\\\n\n& =\\sum_{i=1}^{k} m_{i}-k+2 .\n\n\\end{aligned}\n\n$$"], "answer_type": "Expression", "subfield": "Algebra", "code": ["To determine the largest real number $\\mu$ that satisfies the given condition, we need to analyze the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We have a positive integer $n$.\n   - We need to find the largest $\\mu$ such that for any $4n$-point configuration $C$ in an open unit square $U$, there exists an open rectangle in $U$ with sides parallel to those of $U$ that contains exactly one point of $C$ and has an area greater than or equal to $\\mu$.\n\n2. **Key Insight:**\n   - The key insight here is that we need to consider the worst-case scenario for the distribution of points in the unit square.

In this case, we will show how to modify $\\mathcal{B}$ so that it remains good, contains the same number of sets, but the total number of elements in the sets of $\\mathcal{B}$ increases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider a maximal (relative to set-theoretic inclusion) subcollection $\\mathcal{C} \\subseteq \\mathcal{B}$ such that the set $C=\\bigcup_{A \\in \\mathcal{C}} A$ is distinct from $X$ and from all members of $\\mathcal{C}$.

Now replace in $\\mathcal{B}$ the set $L$ by $C$ in order to obtain a new collection $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$ (then $\\left|\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}\\right|=|\\mathcal{B}|$ ). We claim that $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$ is good.\n\n\n\nAssume, to the contrary, that $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$ contained a tight subcollection $\\mathcal{T}$; clearly, $C \\in \\mathcal{T}$, otherwise $\\mathcal{B}$ is not good. If $\\mathcal{T} \\subseteq \\mathcal{C} \\cup\\{C\\}$, then $C$ is the unique set in $\\mathcal{T}$ containing $x$ which is impossible. Therefore, there exists $P \\in \\mathcal{T} \\backslash(\\mathcal{C} \\cup\\{C\\})$. By maximality of $\\mathcal{C}$, the collection $\\mathcal{C} \\cup\\{P\\}$ does not satisfy the requirements imposed on $\\mathcal{C}$; since $P \\cup C \\neq X$, this may happen only if $C \\cup P=P$, i.e., if $C \\subset P$. But then $\\mathcal{G}=(\\mathcal{T} \\backslash\\{C\\}) \\cup \\mathcal{C}$ is a tight subcollection in $\\mathcal{B}$ : all elements of $C$ are covered by $\\mathcal{G}$ at least twice (by $P$ and an element of $\\mathcal{C}$ ), and all the rest elements are covered by $\\mathcal{G}$ the same number of times as by $\\mathcal{T}$. A contradiction. Thus $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$ is good.\n\n\n\nSuch modifications may be performed finitely many times, since the total number of elements of sets in $\\mathcal{B}$ increases. Thus, at some moment we arrive at a good collection $\\mathcal{B}$ for which the procedure no longer applies. This means that for every $M, N \\in \\mathcal{B}$, either $M \\cup N=X$ or one of them is contained in the other.\n\n\n\nNow let $M$ be a minimal (with respect to inclusion) set in $\\mathcal{B}$.

Thus $|\\mathcal{B}| \\leq\\left|\\mathcal{B}_{+}\\right|+\\left|\\mathcal{B}_{-}\\right|+2 \\leq 2 n-2$, as required.", "We provide yet another proof of the estimate $|\\mathcal{B}| \\leq 2 n-2$.

Arguing indirectly, we assume that there exists a good collection $\\mathcal{B}$ with $|\\mathcal{B}| \\geq 2 n-1$, and choose one such for the minimal possible value of $n$. Clearly, $n>2$.\n\n\n\nFirstly, we perform a different modification of $\\mathcal{B}$. Choose any $x \\in X$, and consider the subcollection $\\mathcal{B}_{x}=\\{B: B \\in \\mathcal{B}, x \\notin B\\}$. By our assumption, $\\mathcal{B}_{x}$ is not tight. As the union of sets in $\\mathcal{B}_{x}$ is distinct from $X$, either this collection is empty, or there exists an element $y \\in X$ contained in a unique member $A_{x}$ of $\\mathcal{B}_{x}$. In the former case, we add the set $B_{x}=X \\backslash\\{x\\}$ to $\\mathcal{B}$, and in the latter we replace $A_{x}$ by $B_{x}$, to form a new collection $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$. (Notice that if $B_{x} \\in \\mathcal{B}$, then $B_{x} \\in \\mathcal{B}_{x}$ and $y \\in B_{x}$, so $B_{x}=A_{x}$.)\n\n\n\nWe claim that the collection $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$ is also good. Indeed, if $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$ has a tight subcollection $\\mathcal{T}$, then $B_{x}$ should lie in $\\mathcal{T}$. Then, as the union of the sets in $\\mathcal{T}$ is distinct from $X$, we should have $\\mathcal{T} \\subseteq \\mathcal{B}_{x} \\cup\\left\\{B_{x}\\right\\}$. But in this case an element $y$ is contained in a unique member of $\\mathcal{T}$, namely $B_{x}$, so $\\mathcal{T}$ is not tight - a contradiction.\n\n\n\nPerform this procedure for every $x \\in X$, to get a good collection $\\mathcal{B}$ containing the sets $B_{x}=X \\backslash\\{x\\}$ for all $x \\in X$. Consider now an element $x \\in X$ such that $\\left|\\mathcal{B}_{x}\\right|$ is maximal. As we have mentioned before, there exists an element $y \\in X$ belonging to a unique member (namely, $B_{x}$ ) of $\\mathcal{B}_{x}$. Thus, $\\mathcal{B}_{x} \\backslash\\left\\{B_{x}\\right\\} \\subset \\mathcal{B}_{y}$; also, $B_{y} \\in \\mathcal{B}_{y} \\backslash \\mathcal{B}_{x}$. Thus we get $\\left|\\mathcal{B}_{y}\\right| \\geq\\left|\\mathcal{B}_{x}\\right|$, which by the maximality assumption yields the equality, which in turn means that $\\mathcal{B}_{y}=\\left(\\mathcal{B}_{x} \\backslash\\left\\{B_{x}\\right\\}\\right) \\cup\\left\\{B_{y}\\right\\}$.\n\n\n\nTherefore, each set in $\\mathcal{B} \\backslash\\left\\{B_{x}, B_{y}\\right\\}$ contains either both $x$ and $y$, or none of them.

First, we note a key property:\n\n\n\nClaim (Sign of $f$ ). $f$ attains wither only nonnegative values, or only nonpositive values.\n\n\n\nProof. This follows from the fact that the zero-set of $f$ is very sparse: if $f$ takes on a positive and a negative value, we can move $A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}$ from the negative value to the positive value without ever having them form a regular $2 n$-gon - a contradiction.\n\n\n\nThe strategy for showing $\\operatorname{deg} f \\geq 2 n$ is the following. We will animate the points $A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}$ linearly in a variable $t$; then $g(t)=f\\left(A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}\\right)$ will have degree at most $\\operatorname{deg} f$ (assuming it is not zero). The claim above then establishes that any root of $g$ must be a multiple root, so if we can show that there are at least $n$ roots, we will have shown $\\operatorname{deg} g \\geq 2 n$, and so $\\operatorname{deg} f \\geq 2 n$.\n\n\n\nGeometrically, our goal is to exhibit $2 n$ linearly moving points so that they form a regular $2 n$-gon a total of $n$ times, but not always form one.\n\n\n\nWe will do this as follows. Draw $n$ mirrors through the origin, as lines making angles of $\\frac{\\pi}{n}$ with each other. Then, any point $P$ has a total of $2 n$ reflections in the mirrors, as shown below for $n=5$. (Some of these reflections may overlap.)\n\n\n\nDraw the $n$ angle bisectors of adjacent mirrors. Observe that the reflections of $P$ form a regular $2 n$ gon if and only if $P$ lies on one of the bisectors.\n\n\n\nWe will animate $P$ on any line $\\ell$ which intersects all $n$ bisectors (but does not pass through the origin), and let $P_{1}, \\ldots, P_{2 n}$ be its reflections. Clearly, these are also all linearly animated, and because of the reasons above, they will form a regular $2 n$-gon exactly $n$ times, when $\\ell$ meets each bisector. So this establishes $\\operatorname{deg} f \\geq 2 n$ for the reasons described previously.\n\n\n\nNow we pass to constructing a polynomial $f$ of degree $2 n$ having the desired property. First of all, we will instead find a polynomial $g$ which has this property, but only when points with sum zero are input. This still solves the problem, because then we can choose\n\n\n\n$$\nf\\left(A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}\\right)=g\\left(A_{1}-\\bar{A}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}-\\bar{A}\\right)\n$$\n\n\n\nwhere $\\bar{A}$ is the centroid of $A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}$. This has the upshot that we can now always assume $A_{1}+\\cdots+A_{2 n}=0$, which will simplify the ensuing discussion.\n\n\n\n<img_3624>\n\n\n\nWe will now construct a suitable $g$ as a sum of squares. This means that, if we write $g=g_{1}^{2}+g_{2}^{2}+$ $\\cdots+g_{m}^{2}$, then $g=0$ if and only if $g_{1}=\\cdots=g_{m}=0$, and that if their degrees are $d_{1}, \\ldots, d_{m}$, then $g$ has degree at most $2 \\max \\left(d_{1}, \\ldots, d_{m}\\right)$.\n\n\n\nThus, it is sufficient to exhibit several polynomials, all of degree at most $n$, such that $2 n$ points with zero sum are the vertices of a regular $2 n$-gon if and only if the polynomials are all zero at those points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, we will impose the constraints that all $\\left|A_{i}\\right|^{2}=x_{i}^{2}+y_{i}^{2}$ are equal. This uses multiple degree 2 constraints.\n\n\n\nNow, we may assume that the points $A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}$ all lie on a circle with centre 0 , and $A_{1}+\\cdots+A_{2 n}=0$. If this circle has radius 0 , then all $A_{i}$ coincide, and we may ignore this case.\n\n\n\nOtherwise, the circle has positive radius. We will use the following lemma.\n\n\n\nLemma. Suppose that $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ are complex numbers of the same non-zero magnitude, and suppose that $a_{1}^{k}+\\cdots+a_{2 n}^{k}=0, k=1, \\ldots, n$. Then $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ form a regular $2 n$-gon centred at the origin. (Conversely, this is easily seen to be sufficient.)\n\n\n\nProof. Since all the hypotheses are homogenous, we may assume (mostly for convenience) that $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ lie on the unit circle. By Newton's sums, the $k$-th symmetric sums of $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ are all zero for $k$ in the range $1, \\ldots, n$.\n\n\n\nTaking conjugates yields $a_{1}^{-k}+\\cdots+a_{2 n}^{-k}=0$, $k=1, \\ldots, n$. Thus, we can repeat the above logic to obtain that the $k$-th symmetric sums of $a_{1}^{-1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}^{-1}$ are also all zero for $k=1, \\ldots, n$. However, these are simply the $(2 n-k)$-th symmetric sums of $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ (divided by $a_{1} \\cdots a_{2 n}$ ), so the first $2 n-1$ symmetric sums of $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ are all zero. This implies that $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ form a regular $2 n$-gon centred at the origin.\n\n\n\nWe will encode all of these constraints into our polynomial. More explicitly, write $a_{r}=x_{r}+y_{r} i$; then the constraint $a_{1}^{k}+\\cdots+a_{2 n}^{k}=0$ can be expressed as $p_{k}+q_{k} i=0$, where $p_{k}$ and $q_{k}$ are real polynomials in the coordinates. To incorporate this, simply impose the constraints $p_{k}=0$ and $q_{k}=0$; these are conditions of degree $k \\leq n$, so their squares are all of degree at most $2 n$.\n\n\n\nTo recap, taking the sum of squares of all of these constraints gives a polynomial $f$ of degree at most $2 n$ which works whenever $A_{1}+\\cdots+A_{2 n}=0$.

A fictitious domino is good if it is completely covered by a domino in the arrangement; otherwise, it is bad.\n\n\n\nIf the fictitious dominoes are all good, then the dominoes in the arrangement that cover no fictitious domino, if any, all lie in two triangular regions of side-length $m-1$ at the upper-left and upper-right corners of the board. Colour the cells of the board chess-like and notice that in each of the two triangular regions the number of black cells and the number of white cells differ by $\\lfloor m / 2\\rfloor$.

A finite number of such transformations eventually leads to an arrangement of at least as many dominoes all of whose fictitious dominoes are good, and the conclusion follows by the preceding.\n\n\n\nConsider the row of minimal rank containing bad fictitious dominoes - this is certainly not the bottom row - and let $D$ be one such. Let $\\ell$, respectively $r$, be the left, respectively right, cell of $D$ and notice that the cell below $\\ell$, respectively $r$, is the right, respectively left, cell of a domino $D_{1}$, respectively $D_{2}$, in the arrangement.\n\n\n\nIf $\\ell$ is covered by a domino $D_{\\ell}$ in the arrangement, since $D$ is bad and no two dominoes in the arrangement form a square, it follows that $D_{\\ell}$ is vertical. If $r$ were also covered by a domino $D_{r}$ in the arrangement, then $D_{r}$ would also be vertical, and would therefore form a square with $D_{\\ell}-$ a contradiction. Hence $r$ is not covered, and there is room for $D_{\\ell}$ to be placed so as to cover $D$, to obtain a new arrangement satisfying the conditions in the statement; the latter has as many dominoes as the former, but fewer bad fictitious dominoes. The case where $r$ is covered is dealt with similarly.\n\n\n\nFinally, if neither cell of $D$ is covered, addition of an extra domino to cover $D$ and, if necessary, removal of the domino above $D$ to avoid formation of a square, yields a new arrangement satisfying the conditions in the statement; the latter has at least as many dominoes as the former, but fewer bad fictitious dominoes.

Colour the cells chess-like so that $(0,0)$ is white. For $0 \\leq i \\leq n-1$, we say that the $i$ th white diagonal is the set of cells of the form $(2 i+k, k)$, where $k$ ranges over all appropriate indices. Similarly, the ith black diagonal is the set of cells of the form $(2 i+1-k, k)$. (Notice that the white cells in the upper-left corner and the black cells in the upper-right corner are not covered by these diagonals.)\n\n\n\nClaim. Assume that $K$ lowest cells of some white diagonal are all covered by dominoes. Then all these $K$ dominoes face right or up from the diagonal. (In other words, the black cell of any such\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndomino is to the right or to the top of its white cell.) Similarly, if $K$ lowest cells of some black diagonal are covered by dominoes, then all these dominoes face left or up from the diagonal.\n\n\n\nProof. By symmetry, it suffices to prove the first statement. Assume that $K$ lowest cells of the $i$ th white diagonal is completely covered. We prove by induction on $k<K$ that the required claim holds for the domino covering $(2 i+k, k)$. The base case $k=0$ holds due to the problem condition. To establish the step, one observes that if $(2 i+k, k)$ is covered by a domino facing up of right, while $(2 i+k+1, k+1)$ is covered by a domino facing down or left, then these two dominoes form a square.\n\n\n\nWe turn to the solution. We will prove that there are at least $d=\\lfloor m / 2\\rfloor$ empty white cells. Since each domino covers exactly one white cell, the required bound follows.\n\n\n\nIf each of the first $d$ white diagonals contains an empty cell, the result is clear. Otherwise, let $i<d$ be the least index of a completely covered white diagonal. We say that the dominoes covering our diagonal are distinguished. After removing the distinguished dominoes, the board splits into two parts; the left part $L$ contains $i$ empty white cells on the previous diagonals. So, it suffices to prove that the right part $R$ contains at least $d-i$ empty white cells.\n\n\n\nLet $j$ be the number of distinguished dominoes facing up. Then at least $j-i$ of these dominoes cover some cells of (distinct) black diagonals (the relation $m \\leq n$ is used). Each such domino faces down from the corresponding black diagonal - so, by the Claim, each such black diagonal contains an empty cell in $R$. Thus, $R$ contains at least $j-i$ empty black cells.\n\n\n\nNow, let $w$ be the number of white cells in $R$. Then the number of black cells in $R$ is $w-d+j$, and at least $i-j$ of those are empty.

Polynomial $Q(y)$ vanishes at each $y=0,1, \\ldots, n$, hence $P\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{k-1}, y\\right)=R\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{k-1}, y\\right)$ for all $x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{k-1}, y \\in\\{0,1, \\ldots, n\\}$. Therefore, $R$ also satisfies the condition of the Lemma; moreover, $\\operatorname{deg}_{y} R \\leq n$. Clearly, $\\operatorname{deg} R \\leq \\operatorname{deg} P$, so it suffices to prove that $\\operatorname{deg} R \\geq n k$.\n\nNow, expand polynomial $R$ in the powers of $y$ :\n$$\nR\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{k-1}, y\\right)=R_{n}\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{k-1}\\right) y^{n}+R_{n-1}\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{k-1}\\right) y^{n-1}+\\cdots+R_{0}\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{k-1}\\right)\n$$\nWe show that polynomial $R_{n}\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{k-1}\\right)$ satisfies the condition of the induction hypothesis.\n\nConsider the polynomial $T(y)=R(0, \\ldots, 0, y)$ of degree $\\leq n$. This polynomial has $n$ roots $y=1, \\ldots, n$; on the other hand, $T(y) \\not \\equiv 0$ since $T(0) \\neq 0$. Hence $\\operatorname{deg} T=n$, and its leading coefficient is $R_{n}(0,0, \\ldots, 0) \\neq 0$. In particular, in the case $k=1$ we obtain that coefficient $R_{n}$ is nonzero.\n\nSimilarly, take any numbers $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{k-1} \\in\\{0,1, \\ldots, n\\}$ with $a_{1}+\\cdots+a_{k-1}>0$. Substituting $x_{i}=a_{i}$ into $R\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{k-1}, y\\right)$, we get a polynomial in $y$ which vanishes at all points $y=0, \\ldots, n$ and has degree $\\leq n$. Therefore, this polynomial is null, hence $R_{i}\\left(a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{k-1}\\right)=0$ for all $i=0,1, \\ldots, n$. In particular, $R_{n}\\left(a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{k-1}\\right)=0$.\n\nThus, the polynomial $R_{n}\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{k-1}\\right)$ satisfies the condition of the induction hypothesis. So, we have $\\operatorname{deg} R_{n} \\geq(k-1) n$ and $\\operatorname{deg} P \\geq \\operatorname{deg} R \\geq \\operatorname{deg} R_{n}+n \\geq k n$.\n\nNow we can finish the solution. Suppose that there are $N$ planes covering all the points of $S$ but not containing the origin. Let their equations be $a_{i} x+b_{i} y+c_{i} z+d_{i}=0$. Consider the polynomial\n$$\nP(x, y, z)=\\prod_{i=1}^{N}\\left(a_{i} x+b_{i} y+c_{i} z+d_{i}\\right)\n$$\nIt has total degree $N$. This polynomial has the property that $P\\left(x_{0}, y_{0}, z_{0}\\right)=0$ for any $\\left(x_{0}, y_{0}, z_{0}\\right) \\in S$, while $P(0,0,0) \\neq 0$. Hence by Lemma 1 we get $N=\\operatorname{deg} P \\geq 3 n$, as desired.", "We present a different proof of the main Lemma 1. Here we confine ourselves to the case $k=3$, which is applied in the solution, and denote the variables by $x, y$ and $z$. (The same proof works for the general statement as well.)\n\nThe following fact is known with various proofs; we provide one possible proof for the completeness.\n\nLemma 2.

By (2), numbers $f(1), f(2), \\ldots$, $f(d)$ have distinct residues modulo $p$; hence there are at least $d$ distinct residues, and $p \\geq d$. On the other hand, by the surjectivity of $f$, there exist $x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{p} \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $f\\left(x_{i}\\right)=i$ for any $i=1,2, \\ldots, p$. By (2), all these $x_{i}$ 's have distinct residues modulo $d$. For the same reasons, $d \\geq p$. Hence, $d=p$.\n\nNow we prove that $f(n)=n$ by induction on $n$. If $n=1$ then, by the Lemma, $p \\nmid f(1)$ for any prime $p$, so $f(1)=1$, and the base is established. Suppose that $n>1$ and denote $k=f(n)$. Note that there exists a prime $q \\mid n$, so by the Lemma $q \\mid k$ and $k>1$.\n\nIf $k>n$ then $k-n+1>1$, and there exists a prime $p \\mid k-n+1$; we have $k \\equiv n-1$ $(\\bmod p)$. By the induction hypothesis we have $f(n-1)=n-1 \\equiv k=f(n)(\\bmod p)$. Now, by the Lemma we obtain $n-1 \\equiv n(\\bmod p)$ which cannot be true.\n\n\n\nAnalogously, if $k<n$, then $f(k-1)=k-1$ by induction hypothesis. Moreover, $n-k+1>1$, so there exists a prime $p \\mid n-k+1$ and $n \\equiv k-1(\\bmod p)$. By the Lemma again, $k=f(n) \\equiv$ $f(k-1)=k-1(\\bmod p)$, which is also false. The only remaining case is $k=n$, so $f(n)=n$.\n\nFinally, the function $f(n)=n$ obviously satisfies the condition."], "answer_type": "Expression", "subfield": "Number Theory", "code": ["To find all surjective functions \\( f: \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N} \\) such that for every \\( m, n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\) and every prime \\( p \\), the number \\( f(m+n) \\) is divisible by \\( p \\) if and only if \\( f(m) + f(n) \\) is divisible by \\( p \\), we need to analyze the given condition carefully.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the Condition:**\n   The condition states that \\( f(m+n) \\) is divisible by \\( p \\) if and only if \\( f(m) + f(n) \\) is divisible by \\( p \\). This implies that the function \\( f \\) must preserve divisibility by \\( p \\) in a very specific way.\n\n2. **Considering Small Values:**\n   Let's start by considering small values of \\( m \\) and \\( n \\). For example, let \\( m = 1 \\) and \\( n = 1 \\). Then the condition becomes:\n   \\[\n   f(2) \\text{ is divisible by } p \\iff f(1) + f(1) \\text{ is divisible by } p \\implies f(2) \\text{ is divisible by } p.\n   \\]\n   This is trivially true since \\( f(2) \\) is divisible by \\( p \\) if and only if \\( 2f(1) \\) is divisible by \\( p \\).\n\n3. **Generalizing for All \\( m \\) and \\( n \\):**\n   Now, let's consider any \\( m \\) and \\( n \\). The condition \\( f(m+n) \\) is divisible by \\( p \\) if and only if \\( f(m) + f(n) \\) is divisible by \\( p \\) must hold for all primes \\( p \\). This implies that \\( f \\) must be a linear function modulo \\( p \\) for each prime \\( p \\).\n\n4. **Linear Function Modulo \\( p \\):**\n   For each prime \\( p \\), \\( f \\) must satisfy:\n   \\[\n   f(m+n) \\equiv f(m) + f(n) \\pmod{p}.\n   \\]\n   This is the definition of a linear function modulo \\( p \\). Therefore, \\( f \\) must be of the form:\n   \\[\n   f(n) = an + b \\pmod{p}\n   \\]\n   for some integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) and for each prime \\( p \\).\n\n5. **Surjectivity:**\n   Since \\( f \\) must be surjective, it must map every natural number to every natural number. This means that for each prime \\( p \\), the function \\( f \\) must cover all residues modulo \\( p \\). The only way this can happen is if \\( a = 1 \\) and \\( b = 0 \\) for all primes \\( p \\). This is because if \\( a \\neq 1 \\), then \\( f(n) \\) would not cover all residues modulo \\( p \\) for some primes \\( p \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   Therefore, the only function \\( f \\) that satisfies the given condition and is surjective is:\n   \\[\n   f(n) = n.\n   \\]\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{f(n) = n}\n\\]"], "pred": ["f(n)=n"], "report": [null], "score": [true]}

If $x>1$, then (1) reads $f\\left(f^{g(x-1)}(x-1)\\right)<y_{1}$, contradicting the minimality of $y_{1}$. So we have that $f(x)=y_{1}$ is equivalent to $x=1$, establishing $(\\mathrm{i})_{1}$.\n\nNext, assume that for some $n$ statement $(\\mathrm{i})_{n}$ is established, as well as all the previous statements in (2). Note that these statements imply that for all $k \\geq 1$ and $a<n$ we have $f^{k}(x)=a$ if and only if $x=a$.\n\nNow, each value $y_{i}$ with $1 \\leq i \\leq n$ is attained at the unique integer $i$, so $y_{n+1}$ exists. Choose an arbitrary $x$ such that $f(x)=y_{n+1}$; we necessarily have $x>n$.

If $b<n$ then we would have $x-1=b$ which contradicts $x>n$. So $b=n$, and hence $y_{n}=n$, which proves (ii) ${ }_{n}$. Next, from (i) ${ }_{n}$ we now get $f(k)=n \\Longleftrightarrow k=n$, so removing all the iterations of $f$ in (3) we obtain $x-1=b=n$, which proves $(\\mathrm{i})_{n+1}$.\n\nSo, all the statements in (2) are valid and hence $f(n)=n$ for all $n$.

By doing so, we find that apart from (11) we also have $|x-y| \\leq m-t-1$ for each collision at point $(x, y)$ and time $t$.\n\nTo visualize this, put\n\n$$\nB(t)=\\left\\{(x, y) \\in[0, m]^{2}: t+1 \\leq x+y \\leq 2 m-t-1 \\text { and }|x-y| \\leq m-t-1\\right\\}\n$$\n\nAn ant can thus only collide with another ant at time $t$ if it happens to be in the region $B(t)$. The following figure displays $B(t)$ for $t=\\frac{1}{2}$ and $t=\\frac{7}{2}$ in the case $m=6$ :\n\n<img_3463>\n\nNow suppose that an NE-ant has its last collision at time $t$ and that it does so at the point $(x, y)$ (if the ant does not collide at all, it will fall off the board within $m-\\frac{1}{2}<\\frac{3 m}{2}-1$ time units, so this case can be ignored).

In each cell we write the number of napkins covering it, and we record the maximal number $k$ of cells that all contain the same nonzero number. Considering all possible napkin configurations, what is the largest value of $k$ ?", "gt_cot": "None", "gt": "3986729", "unit": null, "solution": ["Let $m=39$, then $2011=52 m-17$. We begin with an example showing that there can exist 3986729 cells carrying the same positive number.\n\n<img_3188>\n\nTo describe it, we number the columns from the left to the right and the rows from the bottom to the top by $1,2, \\ldots, 2011$. We will denote each napkin by the coordinates of its lowerleft cell. There are four kinds of napkins: first, we take all napkins $(52 i+36,52 j+1)$ with $0 \\leq j \\leq i \\leq m-2$; second, we use all napkins $(52 i+1,52 j+36)$ with $0 \\leq i \\leq j \\leq m-2$; third, we use all napkins $(52 i+36,52 i+36)$ with $0 \\leq i \\leq m-2$; and finally the napkin $(1,1)$. Different groups of napkins are shown by different types of hatchings in the picture.\n\nNow except for those squares that carry two or more different hatchings, all squares have the number 1 written into them. The number of these exceptional cells is easily computed to be $\\left(52^{2}-35^{2}\\right) m-17^{2}=57392$.\n\nWe are left to prove that 3986729 is an upper bound for the number of cells containing the same number. Consider any configuration of napkins and any positive integer $M$. Suppose there are $g$ cells with a number different from $M$. Then it suffices to show $g \\geq 57392$. Throughout the solution, a line will mean either a row or a column.\n\nConsider any line $\\ell$. Let $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{52 m-17}$ be the numbers written into its consecutive cells. For $i=1,2, \\ldots, 52$, let $s_{i}=\\sum_{t \\equiv i(\\bmod 52)} a_{t}$. Note that $s_{1}, \\ldots, s_{35}$ have $m$ terms each, while $s_{36}, \\ldots, s_{52}$ have $m-1$ terms each. Every napkin intersecting $\\ell$ contributes exactly 1 to each $s_{i}$;\n\n\n\nhence the number $s$ of all those napkins satisfies $s_{1}=\\cdots=s_{52}=s$. Call the line $\\ell$ rich if $s>(m-1) M$ and poor otherwise.\n\nSuppose now that $\\ell$ is rich. Then in each of the sums $s_{36}, \\ldots, s_{52}$ there exists a term greater than $M$; consider all these terms and call the corresponding cells the rich bad cells for this line. So, each rich line contains at least 17 cells that are bad for this line.\n\nIf, on the other hand, $\\ell$ is poor, then certainly $s<m M$ so in each of the sums $s_{1}, \\ldots, s_{35}$ there exists a term less than $M$; consider all these terms and call the corresponding cells the poor bad cells for this line. So, each poor line contains at least 35 cells that are bad for this line.\n\nLet us call all indices congruent to $1,2, \\ldots$, or 35 modulo 52 small, and all other indices, i.e. those congruent to $36,37, \\ldots$, or 52 modulo 52 , big. Recall that we have numbered the columns from the left to the right and the rows from the bottom to the top using the numbers $1,2, \\ldots, 52 m-17$; we say that a line is big or small depending on whether its index is big or small. By definition, all rich bad cells for the rows belong to the big columns, while the poor ones belong to the small columns, and vice versa.\n\nIn each line, we put a strawberry on each cell that is bad for this line. In addition, for each small rich line we put an extra strawberry on each of its (rich) bad cells. A cell gets the strawberries from its row and its column independently.\n\nNotice now that a cell with a strawberry on it contains a number different from $M$. If this cell gets a strawberry by the extra rule, then it contains a number greater than $M$. Moreover, it is either in a small row and in a big column, or vice versa. Suppose that it is in a small row, then it is not bad for its column. So it has not more than two strawberries in this case. On the other hand, if the extra rule is not applied to some cell, then it also has not more than two strawberries. So, the total number $N$ of strawberries is at most $2 g$.\n\nWe shall now estimate $N$ in a different way. For each of the $2 \\cdot 35 \\mathrm{~m}$ small lines, we have introduced at least 34 strawberries if it is rich and at least 35 strawberries if it is poor, so at least 34 strawberries in any case. Similarly, for each of the $2 \\cdot 17(m-1)$ big lines, we put at least $\\min (17,35)=17$ strawberries. Summing over all lines we obtain\n\n$$\n2 g \\geq N \\geq 2(35 m \\cdot 34+17(m-1) \\cdot 17)=2(1479 m-289)=2 \\cdot 57392\n$$\n\nas desired.", "We present a different proof of the estimate which is the hard part of the problem. Let $S=35, H=17, m=39$; so the table size is $2011=S m+H(m-1)$, and the napkin size is $52=S+H$. Fix any positive integer $M$ and call a cell vicious if it contains a number distinct\n\n\n\nfrom $M$. We will prove that there are at least $H^{2}(m-1)+2 S H m$ vicious cells.\n\nFirstly, we introduce some terminology. As in the previous solution, we number rows and columns and we use the same notions of small and big indices and lines; so, an index is small if it is congruent to one of the numbers $1,2, \\ldots, S$ modulo $(S+H)$. The numbers $1,2, \\ldots, S+H$ will be known as residues. For two residues $i$ and $j$, we say that a cell is of type $(i, j)$ if the index of its row is congruent to $i$ and the index of its column to $j$ modulo $(S+H)$. The number of vicious cells of this type is denoted by $v_{i j}$.\n\nLet $s, s^{\\prime}$ be two variables ranging over small residues and let $h, h^{\\prime}$ be two variables ranging over big residues. A cell is said to be of class $A, B, C$, or $D$ if its type is of shape $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}\\right),(s, h),(h, s)$, or $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$, respectively. The numbers of vicious cells belonging to these classes are denoted in this order by $a, b, c$, and $d$. Observe that each cell belongs to exactly one class.\n\nClaim 1. We have\n\n$$\nm \\leq \\frac{a}{S^{2}}+\\frac{b+c}{2 S H}\n\\tag{1}\n$$\n\nProof. Consider an arbitrary small row $r$. Denote the numbers of vicious cells on $r$ belonging to the classes $A$ and $B$ by $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, respectively. As in the previous solution, we obtain that $\\alpha \\geq S$ or $\\beta \\geq H$. So in each case we have $\\frac{\\alpha}{S}+\\frac{\\beta}{H} \\geq 1$.\n\nPerforming this argument separately for each small row and adding up all the obtained inequalities, we get $\\frac{a}{S}+\\frac{b}{H} \\geq m S$. Interchanging rows and columns we similarly get $\\frac{a}{S}+\\frac{c}{H} \\geq m S$. Summing these inequalities and dividing by $2 S$ we get what we have claimed.\n\nClaim 2. Fix two small residue $s, s^{\\prime}$ and two big residues $h, h^{\\prime}$. Then $2 m-1 \\leq v_{s s^{\\prime}}+v_{s h^{\\prime}}+v_{h h^{\\prime}}$. Proof. Each napkin covers exactly one cell of type $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}\\right)$. Removing all napkins covering a vicious cell of this type, we get another collection of napkins, which covers each cell of type $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}\\right)$ either 0 or $M$ times depending on whether the cell is vicious or not. Hence $\\left(m^{2}-v_{s s^{\\prime}}\\right) M$ napkins are left and throughout the proof of Claim 2 we will consider only these remaining napkins. Now, using a red pen, write in each cell the number of napkins covering it. Notice that a cell containing a red number greater than $M$ is surely vicious.\n\nWe call two cells neighbors if they can be simultaneously covered by some napkin. So, each cell of type $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ has not more than four neighbors of type $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}\\right)$, while each cell of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ has not more than two neighbors of each of the types $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}\\right)$ and $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$. Therefore, each red number at a cell of type $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ does not exceed $4 M$, while each red number at a cell of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ does not exceed $2 M$.\n\nLet $x, y$, and $z$ be the numbers of cells of type $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ whose red number belongs to $(M, 2 M]$, $(2 M, 3 M]$, and $(3 M, 4 M]$, respectively. All these cells are vicious, hence $x+y+z \\leq v_{h h^{\\prime}}$. The red numbers appearing in cells of type $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ clearly sum up to $\\left(m^{2}-v_{s s^{\\prime}}\\right) M$. Bounding each of these numbers by a multiple of $M$ we get\n\n$$\n\\left(m^{2}-v_{s s^{\\prime}}\\right) M \\leq\\left((m-1)^{2}-(x+y+z)\\right) M+2 x M+3 y M+4 z M\n$$\n\n\n\ni.e.\n\n$$\n2 m-1 \\leq v_{s s^{\\prime}}+x+2 y+3 z \\leq v_{s s^{\\prime}}+v_{h h^{\\prime}}+y+2 z\n$$\n\nSo, to prove the claim it suffices to prove that $y+2 z \\leq v_{s h^{\\prime}}$.\n\nFor a cell $\\delta$ of type $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ and a cell $\\beta$ of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ we say that $\\delta$ forces $\\beta$ if there are more than $M$ napkins covering both of them. Since each red number in a cell of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ does not exceed $2 M$, it cannot be forced by more than one cell.\n\nOn the other hand, if a red number in a $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$-cell belongs to $(2 M, 3 M]$, then it forces at least one of its neighbors of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ (since the sum of red numbers in their cells is greater than $2 M)$. Analogously, an $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$-cell with the red number in $(3 M, 4 M]$ forces both its neighbors of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$, since their red numbers do not exceed $2 M$. Therefore there are at least $y+2 z$ forced cells and clearly all of them are vicious, as desired.\n\nClaim 3. We have\n\n$$\n2 m-1 \\leq \\frac{a}{S^{2}}+\\frac{b+c}{2 S H}+\\frac{d}{H^{2}}\n\\tag{2}\n$$\n\nProof. Averaging the previous result over all $S^{2} H^{2}$ possibilities for the quadruple $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}, h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$, we get $2 m-1 \\leq \\frac{a}{S^{2}}+\\frac{b}{S H}+\\frac{d}{H^{2}}$. Due to the symmetry between rows and columns, the same estimate holds with $b$ replaced by $c$. Averaging these two inequalities we arrive at our claim.\n\nNow let us multiply (2) by $H^{2}$, multiply (II) by $\\left(2 S H-H^{2}\\right)$ and add them; we get\n\n$H^{2}(2 m-1)+\\left(2 S H-H^{2}\\right) m \\leq a \\cdot \\frac{H^{2}+2 S H-H^{2}}{S^{2}}+(b+c) \\frac{H^{2}+2 S H-H^{2}}{2 S H}+d=a \\cdot \\frac{2 H}{S}+b+c+d$.\n\nThe left-hand side is exactly $H^{2}(m-1)+2 S H m$, while the right-hand side does not exceed $a+b+c+d$ since $2 H \\leq S$.

The total number of flags is $5 \\leq r \\ell$, hence one of the factors (say, $r$ ) should be at least 3 . On the other hand, $\\ell, r \\leq 4$, so there are two flags with coinciding right part; let them be $L_{1} R_{1}$ and $L_{2} R_{1}\\left(L_{1} \\neq L_{2}\\right)$.\n\nNext, since $r \\geq 3$, there exist some flags $L_{3} R_{3}$ and $L_{4} R_{4}$ such that $R_{1}, R_{3}, R_{4}$ are distinct.

Finally, the right parts of two of the flags $L_{1} R_{1}, L_{3} R_{3}, L_{4} R_{4}$ can also form a $2 \\times 2$ square with a blue diagonal by (ii). Putting these $2 \\times 2$ squares on the diagonal of a $4 \\times 4$ square, we find a desired arrangement of four flags.\n\nWe are ready to prove the problem statement by induction on $N$; actually, above we have proved the base case $N=4$.

We call the flags with a blue first square good.\n\nConsider all the good flags and remove the first square from each of them. We obtain at least $2^{N-3}+1 \\geq M_{N-1}$ flags of length $N-1$; by the induction hypothesis, $N-1$ of them\n\n\n\ncan form a square $Q$ with the monochrome diagonal. Now, returning the removed squares, we obtain a rectangle $(N-1) \\times N$, and our aim is to supplement it on the top by one more flag.\n\nIf $Q$ has a yellow diagonal, then we can take each flag with a yellow first square (it exists by a choice of the first column; moreover, it is not used in $Q$ ). Conversely, if the diagonal of $Q$ is blue then we can take any of the $\\geq 2^{N-3}+1-(N-1)>0$ remaining good flags. So, in both cases we get a desired $N \\times N$ square.", "We present a different proof of the estimate $M_{N} \\leq 2^{N-2}+1$.

Let $V$ and $V^{\\prime}$ be the set of columns and the set of flags under consideration, respectively. Next, let the edge $(c, f)$ appear in $E_{\\mathrm{y}}$ if the intersection of column $c$ and flag $f$ is yellow, and $(c, f) \\in E_{\\mathrm{b}}$ otherwise. Then we have to prove exactly that one of the graphs $G_{\\mathrm{y}}$ and $G_{\\mathrm{b}}$ contains a matching with all the vertices of $V$ involved.\n\nAssume that these matchings do not exist.

Our aim is to prove that this is impossible.

Note that each flag is connected to $c$ either in $G_{\\mathrm{y}}$ or in $G_{\\mathrm{b}}$, hence $E_{\\mathrm{y}}\\left(S_{\\mathrm{y}}\\right) \\cup E_{\\mathrm{b}}\\left(S_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right)=V^{\\prime}$.

Similarly: if $(i, j)$ is a T-block then $(i-1, j)$ is a T-block; if $(i, j)$ is an L-block then $(i, j-1)$ is an L-block; if $(i, j)$ is an R-block then $(i, j+1)$ is an R-block.\n\n(ii') Each column contains exactly 25 L-blocks and 25 R-blocks, and each row contains exactly 25 T-blocks and 25 B-blocks. In particular, the total number of L-blocks (or R-blocks, or T-blocks, or B-blocks) is equal to $25 \\cdot 50=1250$.\n\nConsider any B-block of the form $(1, j)$. By $\\left(\\mathrm{i}^{\\prime}\\right)$, all blocks in the $j$ th column are B-blocks; so we call such a column $B$-column. By (ii'), we have 25 B-blocks in the first row, so we obtain 25 B-columns. These $25 \\mathrm{~B}$-columns contain $1250 \\mathrm{~B}$-blocks, hence all blocks in the remaining columns are T-blocks, and we obtain 25 T-columns. Similarly, there are exactly 25 L-rows and exactly 25 -rows.\n\nNow consider an arbitrary pair of a T-column and a neighboring B-column (columns with numbers $j$ and $j+1$ ).\n\n<img_3973>\n\nFig. 1\n\n<img_3920>\n\nFig. 2\n\nCase 1. Suppose that the $j$ th column is a T-column, and the $(j+1)$ th column is a Bcolumn. Consider some index $i$ such that the $i$ th row is an L-row; then $(i, j+1)$ is a BL-block. Therefore, $(i+1, j)$ cannot be a TR-block (see Fig. 2), hence $(i+1, j)$ is a TL-block, thus the $(i+1)$ th row is an L-row. Now, choosing the $i$ th row to be the topmost L-row, we successively obtain that all rows from the $i$ th to the 50th are L-rows. Since we have exactly 25 L-rows, it follows that the rows from the 1st to the 25th are R-rows, and the rows from the 26th to the 50th are L-rows.\n\nNow consider the neighboring R-row and L-row (that are the rows with numbers 25 and 26). Replacing in the previous reasoning rows by columns and vice versa, the columns from the 1 st to the 25th are T-columns, and the columns from the 26th to the 50th are B-columns. So we have a unique arrangement of blocks that leads to the arrangement of kings satisfying the condition of the problem (see Fig. 3).\n\n<img_4043>\n\nFig. 3\n\n<img_3321>\n\nFig. 4\n\nCase 2. Suppose that the $j$ th column is a B-column, and the $(j+1)$ th column is a T-column. Repeating the arguments from Case 1, we obtain that the rows from the 1st to the 25th are L-rows (and all other rows are R-rows), the columns from the 1st to the 25th are B-columns (and all other columns are T-columns), so we find exactly one more arrangement of kings (see Fig. 4)."], "answer_type": "Numerical", "subfield": "Combinatorics", "code": ["To solve this problem, we need to find the number of ways to place 2500 chess kings on a $100 \\times 100$ chessboard such that no two kings can capture each other (i.e., no two kings are placed in two squares sharing a common vertex) and each row and each column contains exactly 25 kings. This is a combinatorial problem that can be approached using the concept of Latin squares and derangements.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We need to place 2500 kings on a $100 \\times 100$ board.\n   - Each row and each column must contain exactly 25 kings.\n   - No two kings can be placed in squares that share a common vertex.\n\n2. **Initial Considerations:**\n   - Since each row and each column must contain exactly 25 kings, we can think of this as a problem of distributing 2500 kings into 100 rows and 100 columns.\n   - The condition that no two kings can be placed in squares that share a common vertex is a constraint that significantly reduces the number of possible arrangements.\n\n3. **Using Latin Squares:**\n   - A Latin square is an $n \\times n$ array filled with $n$ different symbols, each occurring exactly once in each row and exactly once in each column.\n   - In this problem, we need to find a Latin square where each symbol (king) appears exactly 25 times in each row and each column, and no two kings share a common vertex.\n\n4. **Derangements and Combinatorial Arrangements:**\n   - The problem can be approached using derangements and combinatorial arrangements. However, the exact number of such arrangements is not straightforward to calculate directly.\n   - The number of such arrangements is known to be a very large number, and it is typically denoted by a specific combinatorial function or constant.\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n   - The exact number of such arrangements is given by the formula for the number of ways to place 2500 kings on a $100 \\times 100$ board under the given constraints.\n   - This number is a very large number, and it is typically denoted by a specific combinatorial function or constant.\n\nTherefore, the number of such arrangements is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]\n\nThis is because it is impossible to place 2500 kings on a $100 \\times 100$ board such that each row and each column contains exactly 25 kings and no two kings share a common vertex.

Let $A B$ be one of dissecting diagonals and let $\\mathcal{L}$ be the shorter part of the boundary of the 2006-gon with endpoints $A, B$. Suppose that $\\mathcal{L}$ consists of $n$ segments. Then the number of iso-odd triangles with vertices on $\\mathcal{L}$ does not exceed $n / 2$.\n\nProof. This is obvious for $n=2$. Take $n$ with $2<n \\leq 1003$ and assume the claim to be true for every $\\mathcal{L}$ of length less than $n$. Let now $\\mathcal{L}$ (endpoints $A, B$ ) consist of $n$ segments. Let $P Q$ be the longest diagonal which is a side of an iso-odd triangle $P Q S$ with all vertices on $\\mathcal{L}$ (if there is no such triangle, there is nothing to prove). Every triangle whose vertices lie on $\\mathcal{L}$ is obtuse or right-angled; thus $S$ is the summit of $P Q S$. We may assume that the five points $A, P, S, Q, B$ lie on $\\mathcal{L}$ in this order and partition $\\mathcal{L}$ into four pieces $\\mathcal{L}_{A P}, \\mathcal{L}_{P S}, \\mathcal{L}_{S Q}, \\mathcal{L}_{Q B}$ (the outer ones possibly reducing to a point).\n\nBy the definition of $P Q$, an iso-odd triangle cannot have vertices on both $\\mathcal{L}_{A P}$ and $\\mathcal{L}_{Q B}$. Therefore every iso-odd triangle within $\\mathcal{L}$ has all its vertices on just one of the four pieces. Applying to each of these pieces the induction hypothesis and adding the four inequalities we get that the number of iso-odd triangles within $\\mathcal{L}$ other than $P Q S$ does not exceed $n / 2$. And since each of $\\mathcal{L}_{P S}, \\mathcal{L}_{S Q}$ consists of an odd number of sides, the inequalities for these two pieces are actually strict, leaving a $1 / 2+1 / 2$ in excess. Hence the triangle $P S Q$ is also covered by the estimate $n / 2$. This concludes the induction step and proves the lemma.\n\nThe remaining part of the solution in fact repeats the argument from the above proof. Consider the longest dissecting diagonal $X Y$. Let $\\mathcal{L}_{X Y}$ be the shorter of the two parts of the boundary with endpoints $X, Y$ and let $X Y Z$ be the triangle in the dissection with vertex $Z$ not on $\\mathcal{L}_{X Y}$. Notice that $X Y Z$ is acute or right-angled, otherwise one of the segments $X Z, Y Z$ would be longer than $X Y$. Denoting by $\\mathcal{L}_{X Z}, \\mathcal{L}_{Y Z}$ the two pieces defined by $Z$ and applying the lemma to each of $\\mathcal{L}_{X Y}, \\mathcal{L}_{X Z}, \\mathcal{L}_{Y Z}$ we infer that there are no more than 2006/2 iso-odd triangles in all, unless $X Y Z$ is one of them. But in that case $X Z$ and $Y Z$ are odd diagonals and the corresponding inequalities are strict. This shows that also in this case the total number of iso-odd triangles in the dissection, including $X Y Z$, is not greater than 1003.\n\nThis bound can be achieved. For this to happen, it just suffices to select a vertex of the 2006-gon and draw a broken line joining every second vertex, starting from the selected one. Since 2006 is even, the line closes.

We say that these sides belong to the iso-odd triangle $A B C$.\n\nAt least one side in each of these groups does not belong to any other iso-odd triangle. This is so because any odd triangle whose vertices are among the points between $A$ and $B$ has two sides of equal length and therefore has an even number of sides belonging to it in total. Eliminating all sides belonging to any other iso-odd triangle in this area must therefore leave one side that belongs to no other iso-odd triangle.

Note that there are $N=100 ! / 2^{50}$ distinct patterns $P_{1}, \\ldots, P_{N}$.\n\nIf two rows $r \\neq s$ in the table have the same pattern $P_{i}$, then $|T(r, c)-T(s, c)| \\leqslant 1$ holds for all columns $c$. As this violates property (ii) in the problem statement, different rows have different patterns. Hence there are at most $N=100 ! / 2^{50}$ rows.\n\nExistence of a table with $N$ rows. We construct the table by translating every pattern $P_{i}$ into a corresponding row with the numbers $1,2, \\ldots, 100$. We present a procedure that inductively replaces the symbols by numbers. The translation goes through steps $k=1,2, \\ldots, 50$ in increasing order and at step $k$ replaces the two occurrences of symbol $x_{k}$ by $2 k-1$ and $2 k$.\n\n- The left occurrence of $x_{1}$ is replaced by 1 , and its right occurrence is replaced by 2 .\n- For $k \\geqslant 2$, we already have the number $2 k-2$ somewhere in the row, and now we are looking for the places for $2 k-1$ and $2 k$. We make the three numbers $2 k-2,2 k-1,2 k$ show up (ordered from left to right) either in the order $2 k-2,2 k-1,2 k$, or as $2 k, 2 k-2,2 k-1$, or as $2 k-1,2 k, 2 k-2$. This is possible, since the number $2 k-2$ has been placed in the preceding step, and shows up before / between / after the two occurrences of the symbol $x_{k}$.\n\nWe claim that the $N$ rows that result from the $N$ patterns yield a table with the desired property (ii). Indeed, consider the $r$-th and the $s$-th row $(r \\neq s)$, which by construction result from patterns $P_{r}$ and $P_{s}$. Call a symbol $x_{i}$ aligned, if it occurs in the same two columns in $P_{r}$ and in $P_{s}$. Let $k$ be the largest index, for which symbol $x_{k}$ is not aligned. Note that $k \\geqslant 2$. Consider the column $c^{\\prime}$ with $T\\left(r, c^{\\prime}\\right)=2 k$ and the column $c^{\\prime \\prime}$ with $T\\left(s, c^{\\prime \\prime}\\right)=2 k$. Then $T\\left(r, c^{\\prime \\prime}\\right) \\leqslant 2 k$ and $T\\left(s, c^{\\prime}\\right) \\leqslant 2 k$, as all symbols $x_{i}$ with $i \\geqslant k+1$ are aligned.\n\n- If $T\\left(r, c^{\\prime \\prime}\\right) \\leqslant 2 k-2$, then $\\left|T\\left(r, c^{\\prime \\prime}\\right)-T\\left(s, c^{\\prime \\prime}\\right)\\right| \\geqslant 2$ as desired.\n- If $T\\left(s, c^{\\prime}\\right) \\leqslant 2 k-2$, then $\\left|T\\left(r, c^{\\prime}\\right)-T\\left(s, c^{\\prime}\\right)\\right| \\geqslant 2$ as desired.\n- If $T\\left(r, c^{\\prime \\prime}\\right)=2 k-1$ and $T\\left(s, c^{\\prime}\\right)=2 k-1$, then the symbol $x_{k}$ is aligned; contradiction.\n\nIn the only remaining case we have $c^{\\prime}=c^{\\prime \\prime}$, so that $T\\left(r, c^{\\prime}\\right)=T\\left(s, c^{\\prime}\\right)=2 k$ holds. Now let us consider the columns $d^{\\prime}$ and $d^{\\prime \\prime}$ with $T\\left(r, d^{\\prime}\\right)=2 k-1$ and $T\\left(s, d^{\\prime \\prime}\\right)=2 k-1$. Then $d \\neq d^{\\prime \\prime}$ (as the symbol $x_{k}$ is not aligned), and $T\\left(r, d^{\\prime \\prime}\\right) \\leqslant 2 k-2$ and $T\\left(s, d^{\\prime}\\right) \\leqslant 2 k-2$ (as all symbols $x_{i}$ with $i \\geqslant k+1$ are aligned).\n\n- If $T\\left(r, d^{\\prime \\prime}\\right) \\leqslant 2 k-3$, then $\\left|T\\left(r, d^{\\prime \\prime}\\right)-T\\left(s, d^{\\prime \\prime}\\right)\\right| \\geqslant 2$ as desired.\n- If $T\\left(s, c^{\\prime}\\right) \\leqslant 2 k-3$, then $\\left|T\\left(r, d^{\\prime}\\right)-T\\left(s, d^{\\prime}\\right)\\right| \\geqslant 2$ as desired.\n\nIn the only remaining case we have $T\\left(r, d^{\\prime \\prime}\\right)=2 k-2$ and $T\\left(s, d^{\\prime}\\right)=2 k-2$. Now the row $r$ has the numbers $2 k-2,2 k-1,2 k$ in the three columns $d^{\\prime}, d^{\\prime \\prime}, c^{\\prime}$. As one of these triples violates the ordering property of $2 k-2,2 k-1,2 k$, we have the final contradiction."], "answer_type": "Expression", "subfield": "Combinatorics", "code": ["To determine the largest \\( N \\) for which there exists a table \\( T \\) of integers with \\( N \\) rows and 100 columns that satisfies the given properties, we need to analyze the constraints and derive a logical conclusion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding Property (i):**\n   - Every row contains the numbers 1, 2, ..., 100 in some order.\n   - This means each row is a permutation of the numbers 1 through 100.\n\n2. **Understanding Property (ii):**\n   - For any two distinct rows \\( r \\) and \\( s \\), there is a column \\( c \\) such that \\( |T(r, c) - T(s, c)| \\geq 2 \\).\n   - This implies that no two rows can share more than one number in the same column.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Constraints:**\n   - Since each row is a permutation of 100 distinct numbers, and there are 100 columns, each number from 1 to 100 must appear exactly once in each column across all rows.\n   - To satisfy property (ii), no two rows can share more than one number in the same column.

We call a set of lattice points up-right closed if its points stay in the set after being shifted by any lattice vector $(i, j)$ with $i, j \\geqslant 0$. Whenever the butterflies form a up-right closed set $\\mathcal{S}$, we have $|N(p) \\cap \\mathcal{S}| \\geqslant|N(q) \\cap \\mathcal{S}|$ for any two points $p, q \\in \\mathcal{S}$ with $p \\geqslant q$. So, since $\\mathcal{Q}$ is up-right closed, the set of butterflies at any moment also preserves this property. We assume all forthcoming sets of lattice points to be up-right closed.\n\nWhen speaking of some set $\\mathcal{S}$ of lattice points, we call its points lonely, comfortable, or crowded with respect to this set (i.e., as if the butterflies were exactly at all points of $\\mathcal{S}$ ). We call a set $\\mathcal{S} \\subset \\mathcal{Q}$ stable if it contains no lonely points. In what follows, we are interested only in those stable sets whose complements in $\\mathcal{Q}$ are finite, because one can easily see that only a finite number of butterflies can fly away on each minute.\n\nIf the initial set $\\mathcal{Q}$ of butterflies contains some stable set $\\mathcal{S}$, then, clearly no butterfly of this set will fly away. On the other hand, the set $\\mathcal{F}$ of all butterflies in the end of the process is stable. This means that $\\mathcal{F}$ is the largest (with respect to inclusion) stable set within $\\mathcal{Q}$, and we are about to describe this set.\n\n2. A description of a final set. The following notion will be useful. Let $\\mathcal{U}=\\left\\{\\vec{u}_{1}, \\vec{u}_{2}, \\ldots, \\vec{u}_{d}\\right\\}$ be a set of $d$ pairwise non-parallel lattice vectors, each having a positive $x$ - and a negative $y$-coordinate. Assume that they are numbered in increasing order according to slope. We now define a $\\mathcal{U}$-curve to be the broken line $p_{0} p_{1} \\ldots p_{d}$ such that $p_{0} \\in \\mathcal{R}_{\\mathrm{V}}, p_{d} \\in \\mathcal{R}_{\\mathrm{H}}$, and $\\vec{p}_{i-1} \\vec{p}_{i}=\\vec{u}_{i}$ for all $i=1,2, \\ldots, m$ (see the Figure below to the left).\n\n<img_3839>\n\nConstruction of $\\mathcal{U}$-curve\n\n<img_4021>\n\n<img_3612>\n\nConstruction of $\\mathcal{D}$\n\n\n\nNow, let $\\mathcal{K}_{n}=\\{(i, j): 1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n,-n \\leqslant j \\leqslant-1\\}$. Consider all the rays emerging at $O$ and passing through a point from $\\mathcal{K}_{n}$; number them as $r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{m}$ in increasing order according to slope. Let $A_{i}$ be the farthest from $O$ lattice point in $r_{i} \\cap \\mathcal{K}_{n}$, set $k_{i}=\\left|r_{i} \\cap \\mathcal{K}_{n}\\right|$, let $\\vec{v}_{i}=\\overrightarrow{O A_{i}}$, and finally denote $\\mathcal{V}=\\left\\{\\vec{v}_{i}: 1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant m\\right\\}$; see the Figure above to the right. We will concentrate on the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve $d_{0} d_{1} \\ldots d_{m}$; let $\\mathcal{D}$ be the set of all lattice points $p$ such that $p \\geqslant p^{\\prime}$ for some (not necessarily lattice) point $p^{\\prime}$ on the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve. In fact, we will show that $\\mathcal{D}=\\mathcal{F}$.\n\nClearly, the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve is symmetric in the line $y=x$. Denote by $D$ the convex hull of $\\mathcal{D}$.\n\n3. We prove that the set $\\mathcal{D}$ contains all stable sets. Let $\\mathcal{S} \\subset \\mathcal{Q}$ be a stable set (recall that it is assumed to be up-right closed and to have a finite complement in $\\mathcal{Q}$ ). Denote by $S$ its convex hull; clearly, the vertices of $S$ are lattice points. The boundary of $S$ consists of two rays (horizontal and vertical ones) along with some $\\mathcal{V}_{*}$-curve for some set of lattice vectors $\\mathcal{V}_{*}$.\n\nClaim 1. For every $\\vec{v}_{i} \\in \\mathcal{V}$, there is a $\\vec{v}_{i}^{*} \\in \\mathcal{V}_{*}$ co-directed with $\\vec{v}$ with $\\left|\\vec{v}_{i}^{*}\\right| \\geqslant|\\vec{v}|$.\n\nProof. Let $\\ell$ be the supporting line of $S$ parallel to $\\vec{v}_{i}$ (i.e., $\\ell$ contains some point of $S$, and the set $S$ lies on one side of $\\ell$ ). Take any point $b \\in \\ell \\cap \\mathcal{S}$ and consider $N(b)$. The line $\\ell$ splits the set $N(b) \\backslash \\ell$ into two congruent parts, one having an empty intersection with $\\mathcal{S}$. Hence, in order for $b$ not to be lonely, at least half of the set $\\ell \\cap N(b)$ (which contains $2 k_{i}$ points) should lie in $S$. Thus, the boundary of $S$ contains a segment $\\ell \\cap S$ with at least $k_{i}+1$ lattice points (including $b$ ) on it; this segment corresponds to the required vector $\\vec{v}_{i}^{*} \\in \\mathcal{V}_{*}$.\n\n<img_3156>\n\nProof of Claim 1\n\n<img_3490>\n\nProof of Claim 2\n\nClaim 2. Each stable set $\\mathcal{S} \\subseteq \\mathcal{Q}$ lies in $\\mathcal{D}$.\n\nProof. To show this, it suffices to prove that the $\\mathcal{V}_{*}$-curve lies in $D$, i.e., that all its vertices do so. Let $p^{\\prime}$ be an arbitrary vertex of the $\\mathcal{V}_{*}$-curve; $p^{\\prime}$ partitions this curve into two parts, $\\mathcal{X}$ (being down-right of $p$ ) and $\\mathcal{Y}$ (being up-left of $p$ ). The set $\\mathcal{V}$ is split now into two parts: $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{X}}$ consisting of those $\\vec{v}_{i} \\in \\mathcal{V}$ for which $\\vec{v}_{i}^{*}$ corresponds to a segment in $\\mathcal{X}$, and a similar part $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{Y}}$. Notice that the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve consists of several segments corresponding to $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{X}}$, followed by those corresponding to $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{Y}}$. Hence there is a vertex $p$ of the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve separating $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{X}}$ from $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{Y}}$. Claim 1 now yields that $p^{\\prime} \\geqslant p$, so $p^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{D}$, as required.\n\nClaim 2 implies that the final set $\\mathcal{F}$ is contained in $\\mathcal{D}$.\n\n4. $\\mathcal{D}$ is stable, and its comfortable points are known. Recall the definitions of $r_{i}$; let $r_{i}^{\\prime}$ be the ray complementary to $r_{i}$. By our definitions, the set $N(O)$ contains no points between the rays $r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$, as well as between $r_{i}^{\\prime}$ and $r_{i+1}^{\\prime}$.\n\nClaim 3. In the set $\\mathcal{D}$, all lattice points of the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve are comfortable.\n\nProof. Let $p$ be any lattice point of the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve, belonging to some segment $d_{i} d_{i+1}$. Draw the line $\\ell$ containing this segment. Then $\\ell \\cap \\mathcal{D}$ contains exactly $k_{i}+1$ lattice points, all of which lie in $N(p)$ except for $p$. Thus, exactly half of the points in $N(p) \\cap \\ell$ lie in $\\mathcal{D}$. It remains to show that all points of $N(p)$ above $\\ell$ lie in $\\mathcal{D}$ (recall that all the points below $\\ell$ lack this property).\n\n\n\nNotice that each vector in $\\mathcal{V}$ has one coordinate greater than $n / 2$; thus the neighborhood of $p$ contains parts of at most two segments of the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve succeeding $d_{i} d_{i+1}$, as well as at most two of those preceding it.\n\nThe angles formed by these consecutive segments are obtained from those formed by $r_{j}$ and $r_{j-1}^{\\prime}$ (with $i-1 \\leqslant j \\leqslant i+2$ ) by shifts; see the Figure below. All the points in $N(p)$ above $\\ell$ which could lie outside $\\mathcal{D}$ lie in shifted angles between $r_{j}, r_{j+1}$ or $r_{j}^{\\prime}, r_{j-1}^{\\prime}$. But those angles, restricted to $N(p)$, have no lattice points due to the above remark. The claim is proved.\n<img_3487>\n\nProof of Claim 3\n\nClaim 4. All the points of $\\mathcal{D}$ which are not on the boundary of $D$ are crowded.\n\nProof. Let $p \\in \\mathcal{D}$ be such a point. If it is to the up-right of some point $p^{\\prime}$ on the curve, then the claim is easy: the shift of $N\\left(p^{\\prime}\\right) \\cap \\mathcal{D}$ by $\\overrightarrow{p^{\\prime} p}$ is still in $\\mathcal{D}$, and $N(p)$ contains at least one more point of $\\mathcal{D}$ - either below or to the left of $p$. So, we may assume that $p$ lies in a right triangle constructed on some hypothenuse $d_{i} d_{i+1}$. Notice here that $d_{i}, d_{i+1} \\in N(p)$.\n\nDraw a line $\\ell \\| d_{i} d_{i+1}$ through $p$, and draw a vertical line $h$ through $d_{i}$; see Figure below. Let $\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{L}}$ and $\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{R}}$ be the parts of $\\mathcal{D}$ lying to the left and to the right of $h$, respectively (points of $\\mathcal{D} \\cap h$ lie in both parts).\n\n<img_3424>\n\nNotice that the vectors $\\overrightarrow{d_{i} p}, \\overrightarrow{d_{i+1} d_{i+2}}, \\overrightarrow{d_{i} d_{i+1}}, \\overrightarrow{d_{i-1} d_{i}}$, and $\\overrightarrow{p d_{i+1}}$ are arranged in non-increasing order by slope. This means that $\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{L}}$ shifted by $\\overrightarrow{d_{i} p}$ still lies in $\\mathcal{D}$, as well as $\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{R}}$ shifted by $\\overrightarrow{d_{i+1} p}$. As we have seen in the proof of Claim 3, these two shifts cover all points of $N(p)$ above $\\ell$, along with those on $\\ell$ to the left of $p$. Since $N(p)$ contains also $d_{i}$ and $d_{i+1}$, the point $p$ is crowded.\n\nThus, we have proved that $\\mathcal{D}=\\mathcal{F}$, and have shown that the lattice points on the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve are exactly the comfortable points of $\\mathcal{D}$. It remains to find their number.\n\nRecall the definition of $\\mathcal{K}_{n}$ (see Figure on the first page of the solution). Each segment $d_{i} d_{i+1}$ contains $k_{i}$ lattice points different from $d_{i}$. Taken over all $i$, these points exhaust all the lattice points in the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve, except for $d_{1}$, and thus the number of lattice points on the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve is $1+\\sum_{i=1}^{m} k_{i}$. On the other hand, $\\sum_{i=1}^{m} k_{i}$ is just the number of points in $\\mathcal{K}_{n}$, so it equals $n^{2}$.

A tangent segment is a line segment that is a common tangent to two circles, starting at one tangent point and ending at the other one. Luciano is drawing tangent segments on the blackboard, one at a time, so that no tangent segment intersects any other circles or previously drawn tangent segments. Luciano keeps drawing tangent segments until no more can be drawn. Find all possible numbers of tangent segments when he stops drawing.", "gt_cot": "None", "gt": "6048", "unit": null, "solution": ["First, consider a particular arrangement of circles $C_{1}, C_{2}, \\ldots, C_{n}$ where all the centers are aligned and each $C_{i}$ is eclipsed from the other circles by its neighbors - for example, taking $C_{i}$ with center $\\left(i^{2}, 0\\right)$ and radius $i / 2$ works. Then the only tangent segments that can be drawn are between adjacent circles $C_{i}$ and $C_{i+1}$, and exactly three segments can be drawn for each pair. So Luciano will draw exactly $3(n-1)$ segments in this case.\n\n<img_3497>\n\nFor the general case, start from a final configuration (that is, an arrangement of circles and segments in which no further segments can be drawn). The idea of the solution is to continuously resize and move the circles around the plane, one by one (in particular, making sure we never have 4 circles with a common tangent line), and show that the number of segments drawn remains constant as the picture changes. This way, we can reduce any circle/segment configuration to the particular one mentioned above, and the final number of segments must remain at $3 n-3$.\n\nSome preliminary considerations: look at all possible tangent segments joining any two circles. A segment that is tangent to a circle $A$ can do so in two possible orientations - it may come out of $A$ in clockwise or counterclockwise orientation. Two segments touching the same circle with the same orientation will never intersect each other. Each pair $(A, B)$ of circles has 4 choices of tangent segments, which can be identified by their orientations - for example, $(A+, B-)$ would be the segment which comes out of $A$ in clockwise orientation and comes out of $B$ in counterclockwise orientation. In total, we have $2 n(n-1)$ possible segments, disregarding intersections.\n\nNow we pick a circle $C$ and start to continuously move and resize it, maintaining all existing tangent segments according to their identifications, including those involving $C$. We can keep our choice of tangent segments until the configuration reaches a transition. We lose nothing if we assume that $C$ is kept at least $\\varepsilon$ units away from any other circle, where $\\varepsilon$ is a positive, fixed constant; therefore at a transition either: (1) a currently drawn tangent segment $t$ suddenly becomes obstructed; or (2) a currently absent tangent segment $t$ suddenly becomes unobstructed and available.\n\nClaim. A transition can only occur when three circles $C_{1}, C_{2}, C_{3}$ are tangent to a common line $\\ell$ containing $t$, in a way such that the three tangent segments lying on $\\ell$ (joining the three circles pairwise) are not obstructed by any other circles or tangent segments (other than $C_{1}, C_{2}, C_{3}$ ). Proof. Since (2) is effectively the reverse of (1), it suffices to prove the claim for (1). Suppose $t$ has suddenly become obstructed, and let us consider two cases.\n\n\n\nCase 1: $t$ becomes obstructed by a circle\n\n<img_3256>\n\nThen the new circle becomes the third circle tangent to $\\ell$, and no other circles or tangent segments are obstructing $t$.\n\nCase 2: $t$ becomes obstructed by another tangent segment $t^{\\prime}$ \n\nWhen two segments $t$ and $t^{\\prime}$ first intersect each other, they must do so at a vertex of one of them. But if a vertex of $t^{\\prime}$ first crossed an interior point of $t$, the circle associated to this vertex was already blocking $t$ (absurd), or is about to (we already took care of this in case 1). So we only have to analyze the possibility of $t$ and $t^{\\prime}$ suddenly having a common vertex. However, if that happens, this vertex must belong to a single circle (remember we are keeping different circles at least $\\varepsilon$ units apart from each other throughout the moving/resizing process), and therefore they must have different orientations with respect to that circle.\n<img_4010>\n\nThus, at the transition moment, both $t$ and $t^{\\prime}$ are tangent to the same circle at a common point, that is, they must be on the same line $\\ell$ and hence we again have three circles simultaneously tangent to $\\ell$. Also no other circles or tangent segments are obstructing $t$ or $t^{\\prime}$ (otherwise, they would have disappeared before this transition).\n\nNext, we focus on the maximality of a configuration immediately before and after a transition, where three circles share a common tangent line $\\ell$. Let the three circles be $C_{1}, C_{2}, C_{3}$, ordered by their tangent points. The only possibly affected segments are the ones lying on $\\ell$, namely $t_{12}, t_{23}$ and $t_{13}$. Since $C_{2}$ is in the middle, $t_{12}$ and $t_{23}$ must have different orientations with respect to $C_{2}$. For $C_{1}, t_{12}$ and $t_{13}$ must have the same orientation, while for $C_{3}, t_{13}$ and $t_{23}$ must have the same orientation. The figure below summarizes the situation, showing alternative positions for $C_{1}$ (namely, $C_{1}$ and $C_{1}^{\\prime}$ ) and for $C_{3}\\left(C_{3}\\right.$ and $C_{3}^{\\prime}$ ).\n\n<img_3756>\n\n\n\nNow perturb the diagram slightly so the three circles no longer have a common tangent, while preserving the definition of $t_{12}, t_{23}$ and $t_{13}$ according to their identifications. First note that no other circles or tangent segments can obstruct any of these segments. Also recall that tangent segments joining the same circle at the same orientation will never obstruct each other.\n\nThe availability of the tangent segments can now be checked using simple diagrams.\n\nCase 1: $t_{13}$ passes through $C_{2}$\n\n<img_3220>\n\nIn this case, $t_{13}$ is not available, but both $t_{12}$ and $t_{23}$ are.\n\nCase 2: $t_{13}$ does not pass through $C_{2}$\n\n<img_3461>\n\nNow $t_{13}$ is available, but $t_{12}$ and $t_{23}$ obstruct each other, so only one can be drawn.\n\nIn any case, exactly 2 out of these 3 segments can be drawn. Thus the maximal number of segments remains constant as we move or resize the circles, and we are done.", "First note that all tangent segments lying on the boundary of the convex hull of the circles are always drawn since they do not intersect anything else. Now in the final picture, aside from the $n$ circles, the blackboard is divided into regions. We can consider the picture as a plane (multi-)graph $G$ in which the circles are the vertices and the tangent segments are the edges. The idea of this solution is to find a relation between the number of edges and the number of regions in $G$; then, once we prove that $G$ is connected, we can use Euler's formula to finish the problem.\n\nThe boundary of each region consists of 1 or more (for now) simple closed curves, each made of arcs and tangent segments. The segment and the arc might meet smoothly (as in $S_{i}$, $i=1,2, \\ldots, 6$ in the figure below) or not (as in $P_{1}, P_{2}, P_{3}, P_{4}$; call such points sharp corners of the boundary). In other words, if a person walks along the border, her direction would suddenly turn an angle of $\\pi$ at a sharp corner.\n\n\n\n<img_3559>\n\nClaim 1. The outer boundary $B_{1}$ of any internal region has at least 3 sharp corners.\n\nProof. Let a person walk one lap along $B_{1}$ in the counterclockwise orientation. As she does so, she will turn clockwise as she moves along the circle arcs, and not turn at all when moving along the lines. On the other hand, her total rotation after one lap is $2 \\pi$ in the counterclockwise direction! Where could she be turning counterclockwise? She can only do so at sharp corners, and, even then, she turns only an angle of $\\pi$ there. But two sharp corners are not enough, since at least one arc must be present - so she must have gone through at least 3 sharp corners.\n\nClaim 2. Each internal region is simply connected, that is, has only one boundary curve.\n\nProof. Suppose, by contradiction, that some region has an outer boundary $B_{1}$ and inner boundaries $B_{2}, B_{3}, \\ldots, B_{m}(m \\geqslant 2)$. Let $P_{1}$ be one of the sharp corners of $B_{1}$.\n\nNow consider a car starting at $P_{1}$ and traveling counterclockwise along $B_{1}$. It starts in reverse, i.e., it is initially facing the corner $P_{1}$. Due to the tangent conditions, the car may travel in a way so that its orientation only changes when it is moving along an arc. In particular, this means the car will sometimes travel forward. For example, if the car approaches a sharp corner when driving in reverse, it would continue travel forward after the corner, instead of making an immediate half-turn. This way, the orientation of the car only changes in a clockwise direction since the car always travels clockwise around each arc.\n\nNow imagine there is a laser pointer at the front of the car, pointing directly ahead. Initially, the laser endpoint hits $P_{1}$, but, as soon as the car hits an arc, the endpoint moves clockwise around $B_{1}$. In fact, the laser endpoint must move continuously along $B_{1}$ ! Indeed, if the endpoint ever jumped (within $B_{1}$, or from $B_{1}$ to one of the inner boundaries), at the moment of the jump the interrupted laser would be a drawable tangent segment that Luciano missed (see figure below for an example).\n\n<img_3484>\n\n\n\nNow, let $P_{2}$ and $P_{3}$ be the next two sharp corners the car goes through, after $P_{1}$ (the previous lemma assures their existence). At $P_{2}$ the car starts moving forward, and at $P_{3}$ it will start to move in reverse again. So, at $P_{3}$, the laser endpoint is at $P_{3}$ itself. So while the car moved counterclockwise between $P_{1}$ and $P_{3}$, the laser endpoint moved clockwise between $P_{1}$ and $P_{3}$. That means the laser beam itself scanned the whole region within $B_{1}$, and it should have crossed some of the inner boundaries.\n\nClaim 3. Each region has exactly 3 sharp corners.\n\nProof. Consider again the car of the previous claim, with its laser still firmly attached to its front, traveling the same way as before and going through the same consecutive sharp corners $P_{1}, P_{2}$ and $P_{3}$. As we have seen, as the car goes counterclockwise from $P_{1}$ to $P_{3}$, the laser endpoint goes clockwise from $P_{1}$ to $P_{3}$, so together they cover the whole boundary. If there were a fourth sharp corner $P_{4}$, at some moment the laser endpoint would pass through it. But, since $P_{4}$ is a sharp corner, this means the car must be on the extension of a tangent segment going through $P_{4}$. Since the car is not on that segment itself (the car never goes through $P_{4}$ ), we would have 3 circles with a common tangent line, which is not allowed.\n\n<img_3207>\n\nWe are now ready to finish the solution. Let $r$ be the number of internal regions, and $s$ be the number of tangent segments. Since each tangent segment contributes exactly 2 sharp corners to the diagram, and each region has exactly 3 sharp corners, we must have $2 s=3 r$.

We need to find positive rational numbers \\( a_1, a_2, a_3 \\) such that both \\( a_1 + a_2 + a_3 \\) and \\( \\frac{1}{a_1} + \\frac{1}{a_2} + \\frac{1}{a_3} \\) are integers.

Then we have:\n\\[ a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = \\frac{psu + qrt + qst}{qstu} \\]\nand\n\\[ \\frac{1}{a_1} + \\frac{1}{a_2} + \\frac{1}{a_3} = \\frac{qstu + qstu + qstu}{qstu} = \\frac{3qstu}{qstu} = 3. \\]\nFor \\( a_1 + a_2 + a_3 \\) to be an integer, \\( qstu \\) must be a divisor of \\( psu + qrt + qst \\). However, it is not always possible to find such \\( p, q, r, s, t, u \\) that satisfy both conditions for infinitely many tuples. For example, if we try \\( a_1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\), \\( a_2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\), and \\( a_3 = 1 \\), then \\( a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 2 \\) and \\( \\frac{1}{a_1} + \\frac{1}{a_2} + \\frac{1}{a_3} = 3 \\), but if we try \\( a_1 = \\frac{1}{3} \\), \\( a_2 = \\frac{1}{3} \\), and \\( a_3 = \\frac{1}{3} \\), then \\( a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 1 \\) and \\( \\frac{1}{a_1} + \\frac{1}{a_2} + \\frac{1}{a_3} = 9 \\), which does not work. Therefore, there are not infinitely many such tuples for \\( n = 3 \\).\n\nThus, the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) for which there are infinitely many distinct \\( n \\)-tuples of positive rational numbers \\((a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n)\\) such that both \\( a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_n \\) and \\( \\frac{1}{a_1} + \\frac{1}{a_2} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{a_n} \\) are integers is \\( n = 2 \\).\n\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{2}\\)."], "pred": ["2"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

Each cell contains a distinct divisor.\n2. The sum of the divisors in each row is the same.\n3. The sum of the divisors in each column is the same.\n\n### Step 2: Properties of Divisors\nFor a number \\( n \\), let \\( d_1, d_2, \\ldots, d_k \\) be its divisors. The sum of all divisors of \\( n \\) is given by \\( \\sigma(n) \\).\n\n### Step 3: Sum of Divisors\nThe sum of the divisors in each row and each column must be equal.

Therefore, we have:\n\\[ \\sigma(n) = kS \\]\n\n### Step 4: Divisors and Rectangular Table\nFor the divisors to be arranged in a rectangular table, the number of rows \\( r \\) and columns \\( c \\) must satisfy \\( r \\times c = k \\). The sum of the divisors in each row is \\( S \\), so the sum of the divisors in each column is also \\( S \\).\n\n### Step 5: Symmetry and Equal Sums\nFor the sums to be equal, the arrangement must be symmetric. This implies that the divisors must be arranged in a way that the sum of the divisors in each row and each column is the same.\n\n### Step 6: Special Cases\nLet's consider some special cases:\n- If \\( n \\) is a perfect square, its divisors can be arranged in a symmetric table.\n- If \\( n \\) is a prime number, its divisors are 1 and \\( n \\), which can be arranged in a 1x2 table.\n\n### Step 7: General Case\nFor a general \\( n \\), we need to check if the divisors can be arranged in a rectangular table with equal sums.

We claim that the required partition exists and is unique. The two diagonals of the board divide the board into four regions. Note that the domino covering cell $(1,1)$ must be vertical. This in turn shows that each domino covering $(2,2),(3,3), \\ldots,(n, n)$ is vertical. By induction, the dominoes in the left region are all vertical. By rotational symmetry, the dominoes in the bottom region are horizontal, and so on. This shows that the partition exists and is unique.\n<img_3889>\n\nIt remains to show that this value of $k$ is the smallest possible. Assume that only $k<2 n$ cells are marked, and there exists a partition $P$ satisfying the requirement. It suffices to show there exists another desirable partition distinct from $P$. Let $d$ be the main diagonal of the board.\n\nConstruct the following graph with edges of two colours. Its vertices are the cells of the board. Connect two vertices with a red edge if they belong to the same domino of $P$. Connect two vertices with a blue edge if their reflections in $d$ are connected by a red edge. It is possible that two vertices are connected by edges of both colours. Clearly, each vertex has both red and blue degrees equal to 1 . Thus the graph splits into cycles where the colours of edges in each cycle alternate (a cycle may have length 2).\n\nConsider any cell $c$ lying on the diagonal $d$. Its two edges are symmetrical with respect to $d$. Thus they connect $c$ to different cells. This shows $c$ belongs to a cycle $C(c)$ of length at least 4. Consider a part of this cycle $c_{0}, c_{1}, \\ldots, c_{m}$ where $c_{0}=c$ and $m$ is the least positive integer such that $c_{m}$ lies on $d$. Clearly, $c_{m}$ is distinct from $c$. From the construction, the path symmetrical to this with respect to $d$ also lies in the graph, and so these paths together form $C(c)$. Hence, $C(c)$ contains exactly two cells from $d$. Then all $2 n$ cells in $d$ belong to $n$ cycles $C_{1}, C_{2}, \\ldots, C_{n}$, each has length at least 4.\n\nBy the Pigeonhole Principle, there exists a cycle $C_{i}$ containing at most one of the $k$ marked cells.

The binary representation of 2020 is $2020=\\overline{11111100100}_{2}$, so $S_{2}(2020)=7$, and the answer follows.\n\nA strategy for A. At any round, while possible, A chooses two equal nonzero numbers on the board. Clearly, while $A$ can make such choice, the game does not terminate. On the other hand, $A$ can follow this strategy unless the game has already terminated. Indeed, if $A$ always chooses two equal numbers, then each number appearing on the board is either 0 or a power of 2 with non-negative integer exponent, this can be easily proved using induction on the number of rounds. At the moment when $A$ is unable to follow the strategy all nonzero numbers on the board are distinct powers of 2 . If the board contains at least one such power, then the largest of those powers is greater than the sum of the others. Otherwise there are only zeros on the blackboard, in both cases the game terminates.\n\nFor every number on the board, define its range to be the number of ones it is obtained from. We can prove by induction on the number of rounds that for any nonzero number $k$ written by $B$ its range is $k$, and for any zero written by $B$ its range is a power of 2 . Thus at the end of each round all the ranges are powers of two, and their sum is $n$. Since $S_{2}(a+b) \\leqslant S_{2}(a)+S_{2}(b)$ for any positive integers $a$ and $b$, the number $n$ cannot be represented as a sum of less than $S_{2}(n)$ powers of 2 . Thus at the end of each round the board contains at least $S_{2}(n)$ numbers, while $A$ follows the above strategy.

An appropriate strategy for $B$ can be explained as follows: Perform a move so that the situation remains good, while it is possible. We intend to show that in this case $B$ will not lose more than $S_{2}(n)$ cookies. For this purpose, we prove several lemmas.\n\nFor a positive integer $k$, denote by $\\nu_{2}(k)$ the exponent of the largest power of 2 that divides $k$. Recall that, by Legendre's formula, $\\nu_{2}(n !)=n-S_{2}(n)$ for every positive integer $n$.\n\n\n\nLemma 1. The initial situation is good.\n\nProof. In the initial configuration, the number of balanced collections is equal to $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n \\\\ n / 2\\end{array}\\right)$. We have\n\n$$\n\\nu_{2}\\left(\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\nn \\\\\nn / 2\n\\end{array}\\right)\\right)=\\nu_{2}(n !)-2 \\nu_{2}((n / 2) !)=\\left(n-S_{2}(n)\\right)-2\\left(\\frac{n}{2}-S_{2}(n / 2)\\right)=S_{2}(n)=s\n$$\n\nHence $2^{s+1}$ does not divide the number of balanced collections, as desired.\n\nLemma 2. B may play so that after each round the situation remains good.\n\nProof. Assume that the situation $\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{k}\\right)$ before a round is good, and that $A$ erases two numbers, $x_{p}$ and $x_{q}$.\n\nLet $N$ be the number of all balanced collections, $N_{+}$be the number of those having $\\varepsilon_{p}=\\varepsilon_{q}$, and $N_{-}$be the number of other balanced collections. Then $N=N_{+}+N_{-}$. Now, if $B$ replaces $x_{p}$ and $x_{q}$ by $x_{p}+x_{q}$, then the number of balanced collections will become $N_{+}$. If $B$ replaces $x_{p}$ and $x_{q}$ by $\\left|x_{p}-x_{q}\\right|$, then this number will become $N_{-}$. Since $2^{s+1}$ does not divide $N$, it does not divide one of the summands $N_{+}$and $N_{-}$, hence $B$ can reach a good situation after the round.\n\nLemma 3. Assume that the game terminates at a good situation. Then the board contains at most $s$ numbers.\n\nProof. Suppose, one of the numbers is greater than the sum of the other numbers. Then the number of balanced collections is 0 and hence divisible by $2^{s+1}$. Therefore, the situation is not good.\n\nThen we have only zeros on the blackboard at the moment when the game terminates. If there are $k$ of them, then the number of balanced collections is $2^{k}$. Since the situation is good, we have $k \\leqslant s$.\n\nBy Lemmas 1 and 2, $B$ may act in such way that they keep the situation good.

Suppose the machine has $a$ consecutive moves to the next coin, before a move to the previous coin. After those $a$ moves, the $a$ coins flipped in those moves are all heads, as is the coin the machine is now at, so at least the next $a+1$ moves will all be moves to the previous coin.

This certainly determines a unique configuration of coins that could possibly correspond to the given sequence. Furthermore, every coin flipped as part of the $a_{j}$ consecutive moves is also flipped as part of all subsequent sequences of $a_{k}$ consecutive moves, for all $k>j$, meaning that, as we follow the moves backwards, each coin is always in the correct state when flipped to result in a move in the required direction. (Alternatively, since there are $2^{n}$ possible configurations of coins and $2^{n}$ possible such ascending sequences, the fact that the sequence of moves determines at most one configuration of coins, and thus that there is an injection from configurations of coins to such ascending sequences, is sufficient for it to be a bijection, without needing to show that coins are in the right state as we move backwards.)", "We explicitly describe what happens with an arbitrary sequence $C$ of $n$ coins.

For each $n$, what are all possible values for $k(\\mathfrak{L})$, where $\\mathfrak{L}$ is a labyrinth with $n$ walls?", "gt_cot": "None", "gt": "n+1", "unit": null, "solution": ["First we show by induction that the $n$ walls divide the plane into $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+1 \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)+1$ regions. The claim is true for $n=0$ as, when there are no walls, the plane forms a single region. When placing the $n^{\\text {th }}$ wall, it intersects each of the $n-1$ other walls exactly once and hence splits each of $n$ of the regions formed by those other walls into two regions. By the induction hypothesis, this yields $\\left(\\left(\\begin{array}{l}n \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)+1\\right)+n=\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+1 \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)+1$ regions, proving the claim.\n\nNow let $G$ be the graph with vertices given by the $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+1 \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)+1$ regions, and with two regions connected by an edge if there is a door between them.\n\nWe now show that no matter how Merlin paints the $n$ walls, Morgana can place at least $n+1$ knights. No matter how the walls are painted, there are exactly $\\left(\\begin{array}{l}n \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)$ intersection points, each of which corresponds to a single edge in $G$. Consider adding the edges of $G$ sequentially and note that each edge reduces the number of connected components by at most one. Therefore the number of connected components of $\\mathrm{G}$ is at least $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+1 \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)+1-\\left(\\begin{array}{l}n \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)=n+1$. If Morgana places a knight in regions corresponding to different connected components of $G$, then no two knights can ever meet.\n\nNow we give a construction showing that, no matter what shape the labyrinth is, Merlin can colour it such that there are exactly $n+1$ connected components, allowing Morgana to place at most $n+1$ knights.\n\nFirst, we choose a coordinate system on the labyrinth so that none of the walls run due north-south, or due east-west. We then have Merlin paint the west face of each wall red, and the east face of each wall blue. We label the regions according to how many walls the region is on the east side of: the labels are integers between 0 and $n$.\n\nWe claim that, for each $i$, the regions labelled $i$ are connected by doors. First, we note that for each $i$ with $0 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n$ there is a unique region labelled $i$ which is unbounded to the north.\n\nNow, consider a knight placed in some region with label $i$, and ask them to walk north (moving east or west by following the walls on the northern sides of regions, as needed). This knight will never get stuck: each region is convex, and so, if it is bounded to the north, it has a single northernmost vertex with a door northwards to another region with label $i$.\n\nEventually it will reach a region which is unbounded to the north, which will be the unique such region with label $i$. Hence every region with label $i$ is connected to this particular region, and so all regions with label $i$ are connected to each other.\n\nAs a result, there are exactly $n+1$ connected components, and Morgana can place at most $n+1$ knights.", "We give another description of a strategy for Merlin to paint the walls so that Morgana can place no more than $n+1$ knights.\n\nMerlin starts by building a labyrinth of $n$ walls of his own design. He places walls in turn with increasing positive gradients, placing each so far to the right that all intersection points of previously-placed lines lie to the left of it. He paints each in such a way that blue is on the left and red is on the right.\n\nFor example, here is a possible sequence of four such lines $\\ell_{1}, \\ell_{2}, \\ell_{3}, \\ell_{4}$ :\n\n<img_3427>\n\nWe say that a region is \"on the right\" if it has $x$-coordinate unbounded above (note that if we only have one wall, then both regions are on the right). We claim inductively that, after placing $n$ lines, there are $n+1$ connected components in the resulting labyrinth, each of which contains exactly one region on the right. This is certainly true after placing 0 lines, as then there is only one region (and hence one connected component) and it is on the right.\n\nWhen placing the $n^{\\text {th }}$ line, it then cuts every one of the $n-1$ previously placed lines, and since it is to the right of all intersection points, the regions it cuts are exactly the $n$ regions on the right.\n\n<img_3985>\n\nThe addition of this line leaves all previous connected components with exactly one region on the right, and creates a new connected component containing exactly one region, and that region is also on the right. As a result, by induction, this particular labyrinth will have $n+1$ connected components.\n\nHaving built this labyrinth, Merlin then moves the walls one-by-one (by a sequence of continuous translations and rotations of lines) into the proper position of the given labyrinth, in such a way that no two lines ever become parallel.\n\n\n\nThe only time the configuration is changed is when one wall is moved through an intersection point of two others:\n<img_3360>\n\nNote that all moves really do switch between two configurations like this: all sets of three lines have this colour configuration initially, and the rules on rotations mean they are preserved (in particular, we cannot create three lines creating a triangle with three red edges inwards, or three blue edges inwards).\n\nHowever, as can be seen, such a move preserves the number of connected components, so in the painting this provides for Arthur's actual labyrinth, Morgana can still only place at most $n+1$ knights."], "answer_type": "Expression", "subfield": "Combinatorics", "code": ["To determine the possible values for \\( k(\\mathfrak{L}) \\), we need to analyze the structure of the labyrinth and the constraints on the knights' movement.\n\n1. **Understanding the Labyrinth Structure**:\n   - The labyrinth \\(\\mathfrak{L}\\) consists of \\( n \\) walls, each of which is an infinite straight line.\n   - No two walls are parallel, and no three walls intersect at a common point.\n   - Each wall is painted with one side red and the other side blue.\n   - At each intersection of two walls, there are four corners: two diagonally opposite corners where a red side and a blue side meet, one corner where two red sides meet, and one corner where two blue sides meet.\n   - There is a two-way door connecting the two diagonally opposite corners at which sides of different colors meet.\n\n2. **Movement Constraints**:\n   - Knights can only walk through doors and cannot walk through walls.\n   - No two knights can ever meet.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Labyrinth**:\n   - Consider the structure of the labyrinth.

Alice initially distributes pebbles according to $V_{\\left\\lceil\\frac{N}{2}\\right\\rceil}$. Suppose the current configuration of pebbles dominates $V_{i}$. If Bob makes a $k$-move with $k \\geqslant i$ then Alice picks the left group, which results in a configuration that dominates $V_{i+1}$.

Since none of $V_{1}, \\ldots, V_{N}$ contains an empty box, Alice can prevent Bob from ever winning.\n\nFor Bob. The key idea in this solution is the following claim.\n\nClaim. If there exist a positive integer $k$ such that there are at least $2 k$ boxes that have at most $k$ pebbles each then Bob can force a win.\n\nProof. We ignore the other boxes. First, Bob makes a $k$-move (splits the $2 k$ boxes into two groups of $k$ boxes each). Without loss of generality, Alice picks the left group. Then Bob makes a $(k+1)$-move, ... a $(2 k-1)$-move. By Observation A, we may suppose Alice always picks the left group. After Bob's $(2 k-1)$-move, the rightmost box becomes empty and Bob wins.\n\nNow, we claim that if $n<M$ then either there already exists an empty box, or there exist a positive integer $k$ and $2 k$ boxes with at most $k$ pebbles each (and thus Bob can force a win). Otherwise, assume each box contains at least 1 pebble, and for each $1 \\leqslant k \\leqslant\\left\\lfloor\\frac{N}{2}\\right\\rfloor$, at least $N-(2 k-1)=N+1-2 k$ boxes contain at least $k+1$ pebbles.

Let $K=\\left\\lfloor\\frac{N}{2}+1\\right\\rfloor$. Alice starts with the boxes in the configuration $V_{K}$. For each of Bob's $N-1$ possible choices, consider the subset of rounds in which he makes that choice. In that subset of rounds, Alice alternates between picking the left group and picking the right group; the first time Bob makes that choice, Alice picks the group containing the $K^{\\text {th }}$ box. Thus, at any time during the game, the number of pebbles in each box depends only on which choices Bob has made an odd number of times. This means that the number of pebbles in a box could decrease by at most the number of choices for which Alice would have started by removing a pebble from the group containing that box.

We present solutions for the general case of $N>1$ boxes, and write $M=\\left\\lfloor\\frac{N}{2}+1\\right\\rfloor\\left\\lceil\\frac{N}{2}+1\\right\\rceil-1$ for the claimed answer.

Let $K=\\left\\lfloor\\frac{N}{2}+1\\right\\rfloor$. For Bob's strategy, we consider a configuration $X$ with at most $M-1$ pebbles, and we make use of Observation A. Consider two configurations with $M$ pebbles: $V_{K}$ and $V_{N+1-K}$ (if $n$ is odd, they are the same configuration; if $n$ is even, one is the reverse of the other). The configuration $X$ has fewer pebbles than $V_{K}$ in at least one box, and fewer pebbles than $V_{N+1-K}$ in at least one box.\n\nSuppose first that, with respect to one of those configurations (without loss of generality $V_{K}$ ), $X$ has fewer pebbles in one of the boxes in the half where they have $1,2, \\ldots,\\left\\lceil\\frac{N}{2}\\right\\rceil$ pebbles (the right half in $V_{K}$ if $N$ is even; if $N$ is odd, we can take it to be the right half, without loss of generality, as the configuration is symmetric). Note that the number cannot be fewer in the box with 1 pebble in $V_{K}$, because then it would have 0 pebbles. Bob then does a $K$-move. If Alice picks the right group, the total number of pebbles goes down and we restart Bob's strategy with a smaller number of pebbles. If Alice picks the left group, Bob follows with a $(K+1)$-move, a $(K+2)$-move, and so on; by Observation A we may assume Alice always picks the left group. But whichever box in the right half had fewer pebbles in $X$ than in $V_{K}$ ends up with 0 pebbles at some point in this sequence of moves.\n\nOtherwise, $N$ is even, and for both of those configurations, there are fewer pebbles in $X$ only on the $2,3, \\ldots, \\frac{N}{2}+1$ side.

A straightforward induction using (2) in the induction step reveals that we have $f(a+n)=f(b+n)$ for all nonnegative integers $n$.

Now (2) implies\n\n$$\n9 \\cdot 2^{\\alpha}=9 b(2 b-1)-18=(3 b-2)(6 b+1)-16=2^{\\beta}\\left(2^{\\beta+1}+5\\right)-16,\n$$\n\nand by $\\beta \\geqslant 5$ the right-hand side is not divisible by 32 . Thus $\\alpha \\leqslant 4$ and we get a contradiction to (5).\n\n\n\nCase 2.2. $a \\geqslant 3$.\n\nPick an integer $\\vartheta \\in\\{-1,+1\\}$ such that $c-\\vartheta$ is not divisible by 4 .

On the other hand, $2^{\\beta}=a c-b>$ $(a-1) c \\geqslant 2 c$ implies in view of (1) that $a$ and $b$ are smaller than $2^{\\beta-1}$. All this is only possible if $\\vartheta=1$ and $a+b=2^{\\beta-1}$. Now (3) yields\n\n$$\na c-b=2(a+b),\n\\tag{6}\n$$\n\nwhence $4 b>a+3 b=a(c-1) \\geqslant a b$, which in turn yields $a=3$.\n\nSo (6) simplifies to $c=b+2$ and (2) tells us that $b(b+2)-3=(b-1)(b+3)$ is a power of 2. Consequently, the factors $b-1$ and $b+3$ are powers of 2 themselves. Since their difference is 4 , this is only possible if $b=5$ and thus $c=7$. Thereby the solution is complete.", "As in the beginning of the first solution, we observe that $a, b, c \\geqslant 2$. Depending on the parities of $a, b$, and $c$ we distinguish three cases.\n\nCase 1. The numbers $a, b$, and $c$ are even.\n\nLet $2^{A}, 2^{B}$, and $2^{C}$ be the largest powers of 2 dividing $a, b$, and $c$ respectively. We may assume without loss of generality that $1 \\leqslant A \\leqslant B \\leqslant C$. Now $2^{B}$ is the highest power of 2 dividing $a c-b$, whence $a c-b=2^{B} \\leqslant b$. Similarly, we deduce $b c-a=2^{A} \\leqslant a$. Adding both estimates we get $(a+b) c \\leqslant 2(a+b)$, whence $c \\leqslant 2$. So $c=2$ and thus $A=B=C=1$; moreover, we must have had equality throughout, i.e., $a=2^{A}=2$ and $b=2^{B}=2$. We have thereby found the solution $(a, b, c)=(2,2,2)$.\n\nCase 2. The numbers $a, b$, and $c$ are odd.\n\nIf any two of these numbers are equal, say $a=b$, then $a c-b=a(c-1)$ has a nontrivial odd divisor and cannot be a power of 2 . Hence $a, b$, and $c$ are distinct. So we may assume without loss of generality that $a<b<c$.\n\nLet $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ denote the nonnegative integers for which $b c-a=2^{\\alpha}$ and $a c-b=2^{\\beta}$ hold. Clearly, we have $\\alpha>\\beta$, and thus $2^{\\beta}$ divides\n\n$$\na \\cdot 2^{\\alpha}-b \\cdot 2^{\\beta}=a(b c-a)-b(a c-b)=b^{2}-a^{2}=(b+a)(b-a) .\n$$\n\nSince $a$ is odd, it is not possible that both factors $b+a$ and $b-a$ are divisible by 4 . Consequently, one of them has to be a multiple of $2^{\\beta-1}$. Hence one of the numbers $2(b+a)$ and $2(b-a)$ is divisible by $2^{\\beta}$ and in either case we have\n\n$$\na c-b=2^{\\beta} \\leqslant 2(a+b) .\n\\tag{7}\n$$\n\nThis in turn yields $(a-1) b<a c-b<4 b$ and thus $a=3$ (recall that $a$ is odd and larger than 1). Substituting this back into (7) we learn $c \\leqslant b+2$. But due to the parity $b<c$ entails that $b+2 \\leqslant c$ holds as well. So we get $c=b+2$ and from $b c-a=(b-1)(b+3)$ being a power of 2 it follows that $b=5$ and $c=7$.\n\nCase 3. Among $a, b$, and $c$ both parities occur.\n\nWithout loss of generality, we suppose that $c$ is odd and that $a \\leqslant b$. We are to show that $(a, b, c)$ is either $(2,2,3)$ or $(2,6,11)$. As at least one of $a$ and $b$ is even, the expression $a b-c$ is odd; since it is also a power of 2 , we obtain\n\n$$\na b-c=1 \\text {. }\n\\tag{8}\n$$\n\nIf $a=b$, then $c=a^{2}-1$, and from $a c-b=a\\left(a^{2}-2\\right)$ being a power of 2 it follows that both $a$ and $a^{2}-2$ are powers of 2 , whence $a=2$. This gives rise to the solution $(2,2,3)$.\n\n\n\nWe may suppose $a<b$ from now on. As usual, we let $\\alpha>\\beta$ denote the integers satisfying\n\n$$\n2^{\\alpha}=b c-a \\quad \\text { and } \\quad 2^{\\beta}=a c-b\n\\tag{9}\n$$\n\nIf $\\beta=0$ it would follow that $a c-b=a b-c=1$ and hence that $b=c=1$, which is absurd. So $\\beta$ and $\\alpha$ are positive and consequently $a$ and $b$ are even. Substituting $c=a b-1$ into (9) we obtain\n\n$$\n2^{\\alpha}  =a b^{2}-(a+b), \\tag{10}\n$$\n$$\n\\text { and } \\quad 2^{\\beta}  =a^{2} b-(a+b) .\n\\tag{11}\n$$\n\nThe addition of both equation yields $2^{\\alpha}+2^{\\beta}=(a b-2)(a+b)$. Now $a b-2$ is even but not divisible by 4 , so the highest power of 2 dividing $a+b$ is $2^{\\beta-1}$. For this reason, the equations (10) and (11) show that the highest powers of 2 dividing either of the numbers $a b^{2}$ and $a^{2} b$ is likewise $2^{\\beta-1}$. Thus there is an integer $\\tau \\geqslant 1$ together with odd integers $A, B$, and $C$ such that $a=2^{\\tau} A, b=2^{\\tau} B, a+b=2^{3 \\tau} C$, and $\\beta=1+3 \\tau$.\n\nNotice that $A+B=2^{2 \\tau} C \\geqslant 4 C$. Moreover, (11) entails $A^{2} B-C=2$. Thus $8=$ $4 A^{2} B-4 C \\geqslant 4 A^{2} B-A-B \\geqslant A^{2}(3 B-1)$. Since $A$ and $B$ are odd with $A<B$, this is only possible if $A=1$ and $B=3$. Finally, one may conclude $C=1, \\tau=1, a=2, b=6$, and $c=11$. We have thereby found the triple $(2,6,11)$. This completes the discussion of the third case, and hence the solution.

Since $0 \\leqslant j \\leqslant N$, this yields\n\n$$\nf(t)=f(j)+L(f(t)-f(j)) \\cdot S(f(t)-f(j))<f(N)+(t-j) P \\leqslant(P+f(N)) t=c t\n$$\n\nNow let $\\mathcal{T}$ be the set of large primes. For every $t \\in \\mathcal{T}$, Step 1 implies $L(f(t))=t$, so the ratio $f(t) / t$ is an integer. Now Claim 2 leaves us with only finitely many choices for this ratio, which means that there exists an infinite subset $\\mathcal{T}^{\\prime} \\subseteq \\mathcal{T}$ and a positive integer $a$ such that $f(t)=a t$ for all $t \\in \\mathcal{T}^{\\prime}$, as required.\n\nSince $L(t)=L(f(t))=L(a) L(t)$ for all $t \\in \\mathcal{T}^{\\prime}$, we get $L(a)=1$, so the number $a$ is small.\n\nStep 3. We show that $f(x)=$ ax for all $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nLet $R_{i}=\\{x \\in \\mathbb{Z}: x \\equiv i(\\bmod N !)\\}$ denote the residue class of $i$ modulo $N !$.\n\nClaim 3. Assume that for some $r$, there are infinitely many $n \\in R_{r}$ such that $f(n)=a n$. Then $f(x)=a x$ for all $x \\in R_{r+1}$.\n\nProof. Choose any $x \\in R_{r+1}$. By our assumption, we can select $n \\in R_{r}$ such that $f(n)=$ an and $|n-x|>|f(x)-a x|$. Since $n-x \\equiv r-(r+1)=-1(\\bmod N !)$, the number $|n-x|$ is large. Therefore, by Step 1 we have $f(x) \\equiv f(n)=a n \\equiv a x(\\bmod n-x)$, so $n-x \\mid f(x)-a x$. Due to the choice of $n$, this yields $f(x)=a x$.\n\nTo complete Step 3, notice that the set $\\mathcal{T}^{\\prime}$ found in Step 2 contains infinitely many elements of some residue class $R_{i}$. Applying Claim 3, we successively obtain that $f(x)=a x$ for all $x \\in R_{i+1}, R_{i+2}, \\ldots, R_{i+N !}=R_{i}$.

This means \\( f(a) - f(b) > 0 \\).\n\n4. **Prime Factors Greater Than \\( 10^{100} \\)**:\n   - For \\( f(a) - f(b) \\) to have at most as many prime factors greater than \\( 10^{100} \\) as \\( a - b \\), \\( f(a) - f(b) \\) must be a product of primes all less than or equal to \\( 10^{100} \\).\n\n5. **Possible Functions**:\n   - Consider the simplest strictly increasing function, \\( f(x) = x \\). For \\( f(a) - f(b) = a - b \\), the difference \\( a - b \\) has no prime factors greater than \\( 10^{100} \\), so \\(\\mho(a - b) = 0\\).

However, since \\( f \\) is strictly increasing, \\( f(a) - f(b) \\) will always be positive and will have at least one prime factor greater than \\( 10^{100} \\) (because \\( f \\) is strictly increasing and \\( a > b \\)). Therefore, \\(\\mho(f(a) - f(b)) \\geq 1\\), which contradicts the condition \\(\\mho(f(a) - f(b)) \\leq \\mho(a - b)\\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The only strictly increasing function \\( f \\) that satisfies the given condition is \\( f(x) = x \\).\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{f(x) = x}\n\\]"], "pred": ["f(x)=x"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

In fact we have\n\n$$\n\\left|y^{2}-P(x)\\right|=y^{2}+\\frac{x^{2}}{C}+\\frac{(|x|-C)^{2}}{C}+2|x| \\geqslant \\frac{x^{2}}{C}+2|x| \\geqslant 2|x|\n$$\n\nwhere in the first estimate equality can only hold if $|x|=C$, whilst in the second one it can only hold if $x=0$. As these two conditions cannot be met at the same time, we have indeed $\\left|y^{2}-P(x)\\right|>2|x|$.\n\nTo show that $P(0)=1$ is possible as well, we verify that the polynomial $P(x)=x^{2}+1$ satisfies (1). Notice that for all real numbers $x$ and $y$ we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left|y^{2}-P(x)\\right| \\leqslant 2|x| & \\Longleftrightarrow\\left(y^{2}-x^{2}-1\\right)^{2} \\leqslant 4 x^{2} \\\\\n& \\Longleftrightarrow 0 \\leqslant\\left(\\left(y^{2}-(x-1)^{2}\\right)\\left((x+1)^{2}-y^{2}\\right)\\right. \\\\\n& \\Longleftrightarrow 0 \\leqslant(y-x+1)(y+x-1)(x+1-y)(x+1+y) \\\\\n& \\Longleftrightarrow 0 \\leqslant\\left((x+y)^{2}-1\\right)\\left(1-(x-y)^{2}\\right) .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSince this inequality is symmetric in $x$ and $y$, we are done.\n\nPart II. Now we show that no values other than those mentioned in the answer are possible for $P(0)$. To reach this we let $P$ denote any polynomial satisfying (1) and $P(0) \\geqslant 0$; as we shall see, this implies $P(x)=x^{2}+1$ for all real $x$, which is actually more than what we want.\n\nFirst step: We prove that $P$ is even.\n\nBy (1) we have\n\n$$\n\\left|y^{2}-P(x)\\right| \\leqslant 2|x| \\Longleftrightarrow\\left|x^{2}-P(y)\\right| \\leqslant 2|y| \\Longleftrightarrow\\left|y^{2}-P(-x)\\right| \\leqslant 2|x|\n$$\n\nfor all real numbers $x$ and $y$. Considering just the equivalence of the first and third statement and taking into account that $y^{2}$ may vary through $\\mathbb{R}_{\\geqslant 0}$ we infer that\n\n$$\n[P(x)-2|x|, P(x)+2|x|] \\cap \\mathbb{R}_{\\geqslant 0}=[P(-x)-2|x|, P(-x)+2|x|] \\cap \\mathbb{R}_{\\geqslant 0}\n$$\n\nholds for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. We claim that there are infinitely many real numbers $x$ such that $P(x)+2|x| \\geqslant 0$. This holds in fact for any real polynomial with $P(0) \\geqslant 0$; in order to see this, we may assume that the coefficient of $P$ appearing in front of $x$ is nonnegative. In this case the desired inequality holds for all sufficiently small positive real numbers.\n\nFor such numbers $x$ satisfying $P(x)+2|x| \\geqslant 0$ we have $P(x)+2|x|=P(-x)+2|x|$ by the previous displayed formula, and hence also $P(x)=P(-x)$. Consequently the polynomial $P(x)-P(-x)$ has infinitely many zeros, wherefore it has to vanish identically. Thus $P$ is indeed even.\n\n\n\nSecond step: We prove that $P(t)>0$ for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nLet us assume for a moment that there exists a real number $t \\neq 0$ with $P(t)=0$. Then there is some open interval $I$ around $t$ such that $|P(y)| \\leqslant 2|y|$ holds for all $y \\in I$. Plugging $x=0$ into (1) we learn that $y^{2}=P(0)$ holds for all $y \\in I$, which is clearly absurd. We have thus shown $P(t) \\neq 0$ for all $t \\neq 0$.\n\nIn combination with $P(0) \\geqslant 0$ this informs us that our claim could only fail if $P(0)=0$. In this case there is by our first step a polynomial $Q(x)$ such that $P(x)=x^{2} Q(x)$. Applying (1) to $x=0$ and an arbitrary $y \\neq 0$ we get $|y Q(y)|>2$, which is surely false when $y$ is sufficiently small.\n\nThird step: We prove that $P$ is a quadratic polynomial.\n\nNotice that $P$ cannot be constant, for otherwise if $x=\\sqrt{P(0)}$ and $y$ is sufficiently large, the first part of (1) is false whilst the second part is true. So the degree $n$ of $P$ has to be at least 1 . By our first step $n$ has to be even as well, whence in particular $n \\geqslant 2$.\n\nNow assume that $n \\geqslant 4$. Plugging $y=\\sqrt{P(x)}$ into (1) we get $\\left|x^{2}-P(\\sqrt{P(x)})\\right| \\leqslant 2 \\sqrt{P(x)}$ and hence\n\n$$\nP(\\sqrt{P(x)}) \\leqslant x^{2}+2 \\sqrt{P(x)}\n$$\n\nfor all real $x$. Choose positive real numbers $x_{0}, a$, and $b$ such that if $x \\in\\left(x_{0}, \\infty\\right)$, then $a x^{n}<$ $P(x)<b x^{n}$; this is indeed possible, for if $d>0$ denotes the leading coefficient of $P$, then $\\lim _{x \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{P(x)}{x^{n}}=d$, whence for instance the numbers $a=\\frac{d}{2}$ and $b=2 d$ work provided that $x_{0}$ is chosen large enough.\n\nNow for all sufficiently large real numbers $x$ we have\n\n$$\na^{n / 2+1} x^{n^{2} / 2}<a P(x)^{n / 2}<P(\\sqrt{P(x)}) \\leqslant x^{2}+2 \\sqrt{P(x)}<x^{n / 2}+2 b^{1 / 2} x^{n / 2},\n$$\n\ni.e.\n\n$$\nx^{\\left(n^{2}-n\\right) / 2}<\\frac{1+2 b^{1 / 2}}{a^{n / 2+1}}\n$$\n\nwhich is surely absurd. Thus $P$ is indeed a quadratic polynomial.\n\nFourth step: We prove that $P(x)=x^{2}+1$.\n\nIn the light of our first three steps there are two real numbers $a>0$ and $b$ such that $P(x)=$ $a x^{2}+b$. Now if $x$ is large enough and $y=\\sqrt{a} x$, the left part of (1) holds and the right part reads $\\left|\\left(1-a^{2}\\right) x^{2}-b\\right| \\leqslant 2 \\sqrt{a} x$. In view of the fact that $a>0$ this is only possible if $a=1$. Finally, substituting $y=x+1$ with $x>0$ into (1) we get\n\n$$\n|2 x+1-b| \\leqslant 2 x \\Longleftrightarrow|2 x+1+b| \\leqslant 2 x+2,\n$$\n\ni.e.,\n\n$$\nb \\in[1,4 x+1] \\Longleftrightarrow b \\in[-4 x-3,1]\n$$\n\nfor all $x>0$.

We claim that the winner can be decided only from the values of $a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n}$, while $a_{1}$ and $b_{1}$ are actually irrelevant. Suppose that this was not the case, and assume without loss of generality that $a_{2}<b_{2}$. Then the relative order of $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n}$ is fixed, and the position of $b_{1}$ has to decide the winner. Suppose that for some value $b_{1}=x, B$ wins, while for some other value $b_{1}=y, A$ wins.\n\nWrite $B_{x}=\\left\\{x, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n}\\right\\}$ and $B_{y}=\\left\\{y, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n}\\right\\}$, and let $\\varepsilon>0$ be smaller than half the distance between any two of the numbers in $B_{x} \\cup B_{y} \\cup A$. For any set $M$, let $M \\pm \\varepsilon$ be the set obtained by adding/subtracting $\\varepsilon$ to all elements of $M$. By our choice of $\\varepsilon$, the relative order of the elements of $\\left(B_{y}+\\varepsilon\\right) \\cup A$ is still the same as for $B_{y} \\cup A$, while the relative order of the elements of $\\left(B_{x}-\\varepsilon\\right) \\cup A$ is still the same as for $B_{x} \\cup A$. Thus $A<B_{x}-\\varepsilon$, but $A>B_{y}+\\varepsilon$. Moreover, if $y>x$, then $B_{x}-\\varepsilon \\prec B_{y}+\\varepsilon$ by condition 2, while otherwise the relative order of\n\n\n\nthe elements in $\\left(B_{x}-\\varepsilon\\right) \\cup\\left(B_{y}+\\varepsilon\\right)$ is the same as for the two sets $\\{2\\} \\cup\\{2 i-1 \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n\\}$ and $\\{1\\} \\cup\\{2 i \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n\\}$, so that $B_{x}-\\varepsilon<B_{y}+\\varepsilon$. In either case, we obtain\n\n$$\nA \\prec B_{x}-\\varepsilon \\prec B_{y}+\\varepsilon<A,\n$$\n\nwhich contradicts condition 3 .\n\nSo we know now that the winner does not depend on $a_{1}, b_{1}$. Therefore, we can define a new rule $<^{*}$ on sets of cardinality $n-1$ by saying that $A \\prec^{*} B$ if and only if $A \\cup\\{a\\} \\prec B \\cup\\{b\\}$ for some $a, b$ (or equivalently, all $a, b$ ) such that $a<\\min A, b<\\min B$ and $A \\cup\\{a\\}$ and $B \\cup\\{b\\}$ are disjoint. The rule $<^{*}$ satisfies all conditions again, so by the induction hypothesis, there exists an index $i$ such that $A \\prec^{*} B$ if and only if the $i^{\\text {th }}$ smallest element of $A$ is less than the $i^{\\text {th }}$ smallest element of $B$. This implies that $C<D$ if and only if the $(i+1)^{\\text {th }}$ smallest element of $C$ is less than the $(i+1)^{\\text {th }}$ smallest element of $D$, which completes our induction.\n\nSecond case: $(\\{2 i-1 \\mid 1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-1\\} \\cup\\{2 n\\})<(\\{2 i \\mid 1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-1\\} \\cup\\{2 n-1\\})$.

This means that\n\n$$\nx f(x)+x f(x)>2\n$$\n\nand thus $x f(x)>1$. Similarly, $(y, x)$ is a good pair, so $(y, y)$ is not a good pair, which implies $y f(y)>1$. We apply the AM-GM inequality to obtain\n\n$$\nx f(y)+y f(x) \\geqslant 2 \\sqrt{x f(y) \\cdot y f(x)}=2 \\sqrt{x f(x) \\cdot y f(y)}>2\n$$\n\nThis is a contradiction, since $(x, y)$ is a good pair.\n\nBy assumption, for any $x>0$, there always exists a good pair containing $x$, however Lemma 1 implies that the only good pair that can contain $x$ is $(x, x)$, so\n\n$$\nx f(x) \\leqslant 1 \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad f(x) \\leqslant \\frac{1}{x},\n$$\n\nfor every $x>0$.\n\nIn particular, with $x=1 / f(t)$ for $t>0$, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{f(t)} \\cdot f\\left(\\frac{1}{f(t)}\\right) \\leqslant 1\n$$\n\nHence\n\n$$\nt \\cdot f\\left(\\frac{1}{f(t)}\\right) \\leqslant t f(t) \\leqslant 1\n$$\n\nWe claim that $(t, 1 / f(t))$ is a good pair for every $t>0$. Indeed,\n\n$$\nt \\cdot f\\left(\\frac{1}{f(t)}\\right)+\\frac{1}{f(t)} f(t)=t \\cdot f\\left(\\frac{1}{f(t)}\\right)+1 \\leqslant 2\n$$\n\nLemma 1 implies that $t=1 / f(t) \\Longleftrightarrow f(t)=1 / t$ for every $t>0$.\n\n\n1. We give an alternative way to prove that $f(x)=1 / x$ assuming $f(x) \\leqslant 1 / x$ for every $x>0$.\n\nIndeed, if $f(x)<1 / x$ then for every $a>0$ with $f(x)<1 / a<1 / x$ (and there are at least two of them), we have\n\n$$\na f(x)+x f(a)<1+\\frac{x}{a}<2 .\n$$\n\nHence $(x, a)$ is a good pair for every such $a$, a contradiction. We conclude that $f(x)=1 / x$.\n\n\n2. We can also conclude from Lemma 1 and $f(x) \\leqslant 1 / x$ as follows.\n\nLemma 2. The function $f$ is decreasing.\n\nProof. Let $y>x>0$. Lemma 1 says that $(x, y)$ is not a good pair, but $(y, y)$ is. Hence\n\n$$\nx f(y)+y f(x)>2 \\geqslant 2 y f(y)>y f(y)+x f(y),\n$$\n\nwhere we used $y>x$ (and $f(y)>0$ ) in the last inequality. This implies that $f(x)>f(y)$, showing that $f$ is decreasing.\n\nWe now prove that $f(x)=1 / x$ for all $x$. Fix a value of $x$ and note that for $y>x$ we must have $x f(x)+y f(x)>x f(y)+y f(x)>2$ (using that $f$ is decreasing for the first step), hence $f(x)>\\frac{2}{x+y}$. The last inequality is true for every $y>x>0$. If we fix $x$ and look for the supremum of the expression $\\frac{2}{x+y}$ over all $y>x$, we get\n\n$$\nf(x) \\geqslant \\frac{2}{x+x}=\\frac{1}{x}\n$$\n\nSince we already know that $f(x) \\leqslant 1 / x$, we conclude that $f(x)=1 / x$.", "As in the first solution, we note that $f(x)=1 / x$ is a solution, and we set out to prove that it is the only one. We write $g(x)$ for the unique positive real number such that $(x, g(x))$ is a good pair. In this solution, we prove Lemma 2 without assuming Lemma 1.\n\nLemma 2. The function $f$ is decreasing.\n\nProof. Consider $x<y$. It holds that $y f(g(y))+g(y) f(y) \\leqslant 2$. Moreover, because $y$ is the only positive real number such that $(g(y), y)$ is a good pair and $x \\neq y$, we have $x f(g(y))+g(y) f(x)>$ 2. Combining these two inequalities yields\n\n$$\nx f(g(y))+g(y) f(x)>2 \\geqslant y f(g(y))+g(y) f(y)\n$$\n\nor $f(g(y))(x-y)>g(y)(f(y)-f(x))$. Because $g(y)$ and $f(g(y))$ are both positive while $x-y$ is negative, it follows that $f(y)<f(x)$, showing that $f$ is decreasing.\n\nWe now prove Lemma 1 using Lemma 2. Suppose that $x \\neq y$ but $x f(y)+y f(x) \\leqslant 2$. As in the first solution, we get $x f(x)+x f(x)>2$ and $y f(y)+y f(y)>2$, which implies $x f(x)+y f(y)>2$. Now\n\n$$\nx f(x)+y f(y)>2 \\geqslant x f(y)+y f(x)\n$$\n\nimplies $(x-y)(f(x)-f(y))>0$, which contradicts the fact that $f$ is decreasing. So $y=x$ is the unique $y$ such that $(x, y)$ is a good pair, and in particular we have $f(x) \\leqslant 1 / x$.\n\nWe can now conclude the proof", "As in the other solutions we verify that the function $f(x)=1 / x$ is a solution. We first want to prove the following lemma:\n\nLemma 3. For all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}_{>0}$ we actually have $x f(g(x))+g(x) f(x)=2$ (that is: the inequality is actually an equality).\n\n\n\nProof. We proceed by contradiction: Assume there exists some number $x>0$ such that for $y=g(x)$ we have $x f(y)+y f(x)<2$. Then for any $0<\\epsilon<\\frac{2-x f(y)-y f(x)}{2 f(x)}$ we have, by uniqueness of $y$, that $x f(y+\\epsilon)+(y+\\epsilon) f(x)>2$. Therefore\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nf(y+\\epsilon) & >\\frac{2-(y+\\epsilon) f(x)}{x}=\\frac{2-y f(x)-\\epsilon f(x)}{x} \\\\\n& >\\frac{2-y f(x)-\\frac{2-x f(y)-y f(x)}{2}}{x} \\\\\n& =\\frac{2-x f(y)-y f(x)}{2 x}+f(y)>f(y) .\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{1}\n$$\n\nFurthermore, for every such $\\epsilon$ we have $g(y+\\epsilon) f(y+\\epsilon)+(y+\\epsilon) f(g(y+\\epsilon)) \\leqslant 2$ and $g(y+\\epsilon) f(y)+y f(g(y+\\epsilon))>2($ since $y \\neq y+\\epsilon=g(g(y+\\epsilon)))$. This gives us the two inequalities\n\n$$\nf(g(y+\\epsilon)) \\leqslant \\frac{2-g(y+\\epsilon) f(y+\\epsilon)}{y+\\epsilon} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad f(g(y+\\epsilon))>\\frac{2-g(y+\\epsilon) f(y)}{y} \\text {. }\n$$\n\nCombining these two inequalities and rearranging the terms leads to the inequality\n\n$$\n2 \\epsilon<g(y+\\epsilon)[(y+\\epsilon) f(y)-y f(y+\\epsilon)] \\text {. }\n$$\n\nMoreover combining with the inequality (1) we obtain\n\n$$\n2 \\epsilon<g(y+\\epsilon)\\left[(y+\\epsilon) f(y)-y\\left(\\frac{2-x f(y)-y f(x)}{2 x}+f(y)\\right)\\right]=g(y+\\epsilon)\\left[\\epsilon f(y)-y \\frac{2-x f(y)-y f(x)}{2 x}\\right]\n$$\n\nWe now reach the desired contradiction, since for $\\epsilon$ sufficiently small we have that the left hand side is positive while the right hand side is negative.\n\nWith this lemma it then follows that for all $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}_{>0}$ we have\n\n$$\nx f(y)+y f(x) \\geqslant 2\n$$\n\nsince for $y=g(x)$ we have equality and by uniqueness for $y \\neq g(x)$ the inequality is strict.\n\nIn particular for every $x \\in \\mathbb{R}_{>0}$ and for $y=x$ we have $2 x f(x) \\geqslant 2$, or equivalently $f(x) \\geqslant 1 / x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}_{>0}$. With this inequality we obtain for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}_{>0}$\n\n$$\n2 \\geqslant x f(g(x))+g(x) f(x) \\geqslant \\frac{x}{g(x)}+\\frac{g(x)}{x} \\geqslant 2\n$$\n\nwhere the first inequality comes from the problem statement. Consequently each of these inequalities must actually be an equality, and in particular we obtain $f(x)=1 / x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}_{>0}$.", "Again, let us prove that $f(x)=1 / x$ is the only solution. Let again $g(x)$ be the unique positive real number such that $(x, g(x))$ is a good pair.\n\nLemma 4. The function $f$ is strictly convex.\n\nProof. Consider the function $q_{s}(x)=f(x)+s x$ for some real number $s$. If $f$ is not strictly convex, then there exist $u<v$ and $t \\in(0,1)$ such that\n\n$$\nf(t u+(1-t) v) \\geqslant t f(u)+(1-t) f(v) .\n$$\n\nHence\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nq_{s}(t u+(1-t) v) & \\geqslant t f(u)+(1-t) f(v)+s(t u+(1-t) v) \\\\\n& =t q_{s}(u)+(1-t) q_{s}(v)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n\n\nLet $w=t u+(1-t) v$ and consider the case $s=f(g(w)) / g(w)$. For that particular choice of $s$, the function $q_{s}(x)$ has a unique minimum at $x=w$. However, since $q_{s}(w) \\geqslant t q_{s}(u)+(1-t) q_{s}(v)$, it must hold $q_{s}(u) \\leqslant q_{s}(w)$ or $q_{s}(v) \\leqslant q_{s}(w)$, a contradiction.\n\nLemma 5. The function $f$ is continuous.\n\nProof. Since $f$ is strictly convex and defined on an open interval, it is also continuous.\n\nwe can now prove that $f(x) \\leqslant 1 / x$. If $f(x)<1 / x$, then we consider the function $h(y)=x f(y)+y f(x)$ which is continuous. Since $h(x)<2$, there exist at least two distinct $z \\neq x$ such that $h(z)<2$ giving that $(x, z)$ is good pair for both values of $z$, a contradiction.

For example, if we start with tuples $(0, 0, \\ldots, 0)$ and $(1, 1, \\ldots, 1)$, we can generate any tuple with a sum of 1 by adding these tuples.\n- **Maximum Operation:** This operation can generate tuples with any maximum value of corresponding elements. For example, if we start with tuples $(0, 0, \\ldots, 0)$ and $(1, 1, \\ldots, 1)$, we can generate any tuple with a maximum value of 1 by taking the maximum of these tuples.\n\n### Step 3: Initial Tuples\nTo generate all possible integer-valued 2022-tuples, we need to start with a set of tuples that can generate all possible sums and maximum values. The simplest set of tuples that can generate all possible sums and maximum values is the set of tuples $(0, 0, \\ldots, 0)$ and $(1, 1, \\ldots, 1)$.\n\n### Step 4: Verifying the Smallest Number of Tuples\n- **Tuples $(0, 0, \\ldots, 0)$:** This tuple can generate any tuple with a sum of 0.\n- **Tuples $(1, 1, \\ldots, 1)$:** This tuple can generate any tuple with a maximum value of 1.\n\nBy combining these two tuples, we can generate any integer-valued 2022-tuple.

Therefore, if we fill in the fields in $B$ in increasing order with respect to their values in $A$, it follows that each field not adjacent to any already filled field will receive a 1, while each field adjacent to already filled fields will receive the sum of the numbers already written on these adjacent fields.\n\nWe note that there is at least one well in $A$, that corresponding with the field with the entry 1 in $A$. Hence, the sum of values of fields in $B$ corresponding to wells in $A$ is at least 1 . We will now try to minimize the sum of the non-well entries, i.e. of the entries in $B$ corresponding to the non-wells in $A$. We note that we can ascribe to each pair of adjacent fields the value of the lower assigned number and that the sum of non-well entries will then equal to the sum of the ascribed numbers. Since the lower number is still at least 1, the sum of non-well entries will at least equal the number of pairs of adjacent fields, which is $2 n(n-1)$. Hence, the total minimum sum of entries in $B$ is at least $2 n(n-1)+1=2 n^{2}-2 n+1$.

It is not hard to see that needles and non-needles are both closed under addition, and thus under scalar division (whenever the quotient lives in $\\mathbb{Z}^{2}$ ).\n\nIn addition, call a positive rational number $\\frac{k}{l}$ a grade if the vector $(k, l)$ is a needle. (Since needles are closed under scalar multiples and quotients, this is well-defined.)\n\nClaim. Grades are closed upwards.\n\nProof. Consider positive rationals $k_{1} / l_{1}<k_{2} / l_{2}$ with $k_{1} / l_{1}$ a grade. Then:\n\n- $\\left(k_{1}, l_{1}\\right)$ is a needle\n- so $\\left(k_{1} l_{2}, l_{1} l_{2}\\right)$ is a needle,\n- so $\\left(k_{2} l_{1}, l_{1} l_{2}\\right)$ is a needle (as $k_{2} l_{1}-k_{1} l_{2}>0$ and $(1,0)$ is a needle).\n\nThus $\\left(k_{2}, l_{2}\\right)$ is a needle, as wanted.\n\nClaim. A grade exists.\n\nProof. If no positive integer $n$ is a grade, then $f(1,0)>f(0, n)$ for all $n$ which is impossible.\n\nSimilarly, there is an $n$ such that $f(0,1)<f(n, 0)$, thus $1 / n$ is not a grade for some large $n$. That means that small positive rational values are not grades, then there is a switch, and after that all values are grades. Call the place of that switch $\\alpha$. Here $\\alpha$ is the infimum of the grades.\n\nClaim (Key property). If $x_{1}+y_{1} \\alpha>x_{2}+y_{2} \\alpha$ then $f\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)>f\\left(x_{2}, y_{2}\\right)$.\n\nProof. If both $x_{1} \\geqslant x_{2}$ and $y_{1} \\geqslant y_{2}$ this is clear.\n\nSuppose $x_{1} \\geqslant x_{2}$ and $y_{1}<y_{2}$. Then $\\frac{x_{1}-x_{2}}{y_{2}-y_{1}}>\\alpha$ is a grade. This gives $f\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)>f\\left(x_{2}, y_{2}\\right)$. Suppose $x_{1}<x_{2}$ and $y_{1} \\geqslant y_{2}$. Then $\\frac{x_{2}-x_{1}}{u_{1}-u_{2}}<\\alpha$ is not a grade. This gives $f\\left(x_{2}, y_{2}\\right)<f\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$.\n\nFrom those observations we get the following claim.\n\nClaim. The function $f$ orders pairs $(x, y)$ based on the value of $x+y \\alpha$. If $\\alpha$ is rational, tiebreaking is done by larger $x$ - or $y$-coordinate (depending on whether $\\alpha$ is a grade).\n\n\n\nWe can imagine this the following way: take a line with slope $-\\frac{1}{\\alpha}$ under the first quadrant of the plane. And we start to move this line upward (but it stays parallel to the original line). First it hits $(0,0)$, so $f(0,0)=0$. And each time the line hits a point $p, f(p)$ is the number of points hit before. If $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, it is possible that the line hits multiple points. Then those points are ordered the same way as their $x$ or $y$ coordinates, depending on whether $\\alpha$ is a grade.\n\nWe understood the behaviour of $f$, now we need to focus on the region of $A=\\{(x, y) \\in$ $\\left.\\mathbb{Z}_{\\geqslant 0} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{\\geqslant 0} \\mid x<100, y<100\\right\\}$. First, we can assume that $\\alpha$ is irrational.

We use induction on $n$. The base case $n=2$ is routine. To perform the induction step, we need to prove the inequalities\n\n$$\n\\frac{S(n, n)}{n} \\leqslant \\frac{S(n, k)}{k} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\frac{S(n, k)}{k} \\leqslant \\frac{S(n, n-1)}{n-1}\n\\tag{1}\n$$\n\nfor every positive integer $k \\leqslant n$. Clearly, these inequalities hold for $k=n$ and $k=n-1$, as $S(n, n)=S(n, n-1)>0$. In the sequel, we assume that $k<n-1$.\n\nNow the first inequality in (1) rewrites as $n S(n, k) \\geqslant k S(n, n)=k(S(n, k)+S(n-k, n-k))$, or, cancelling the terms occurring on both parts, as\n\n$$\n(n-k) S(n, k) \\geqslant k S(n-k, n-k) \\Longleftrightarrow S(n, k) \\geqslant k \\cdot \\frac{S(n-k, n-k)}{n-k}\n$$\n\nBy the induction hypothesis, we have $S(n-k, n-k) /(n-k)=m_{n-k}$. By Claim 3, we get $a_{n-i} \\geqslant m_{n-k}$ for all $i=1,2, \\ldots, k$. Summing these $k$ inequalities we obtain\n\n$$\nS(n, k) \\geqslant k m_{n-k}=k \\cdot \\frac{S(n-k, n-k)}{n-k}\n$$\n\nas required.\n\nThe second inequality in (1) is proved similarly.

Next, we find an optimal permutation and an optimal tournament.\n\nOptimisation for a fixed $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 k}$. We say that the cost of the match between $P_{i}$ and $P_{j}$ is the number of players present at the tournament when this match is played. Clearly, the Committee pays for each day the cost of the match of that day. Hence, we are to minimise the total cost of all matches.\n\nNotice that $Q_{2 k}$ 's departure does not precede $P_{2 k}$ 's arrival. Hence, the number of players at the tournament monotonically increases (non-strictly) until it reaches $2 k$, and then monotonically decreases (non-strictly). So, the best time to schedule the match between $P_{i}$ and $P_{j}$ is either when $P_{\\max (i, j)}$ arrives, or when $Q_{\\max \\left(a_{i}, a_{j}\\right)}$ departs, in which case the cost is $\\min \\left(\\max (i, j), \\max \\left(a_{i}, a_{j}\\right)\\right)$.\n\nConversely, assuming that $i>j$, if this match is scheduled between the arrivals of $P_{i}$ and $P_{i+1}$, then its cost will be exactly $i=\\max (i, j)$.

This means that $B_{i}$ and $B_{j}$ intersect if and only if $i$ and $j$ are not consecutive modulo $n$.\n\n2. **Visualizing the Boxes**: To visualize this, imagine placing the boxes on a grid. Each box $B_{i}$ can be represented as a rectangle with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The condition implies that the boxes must be placed in such a way that no two boxes are adjacent (either horizontally or vertically).\n\n3. **Finding the Largest $n$**: To find the largest $n$ for which such a configuration is possible, we need to consider the maximum number of non-adjacent boxes that can be placed on a grid. This is equivalent to finding the maximum number of non-adjacent points on a grid.\n\n4. **Using the Pigeonhole Principle**: The pigeonhole principle states that if $n$ items are put into $m$ containers, with $n > m$, then at least one container must contain more than one item. In this context, we can think of the boxes as items and the grid as containers. If we place $n$ boxes on a grid, we need to ensure that no two boxes are adjacent.\n\n5. **Calculating the Maximum $n$**: The maximum number of non-adjacent boxes that can be placed on a grid is given by the formula $n = 2^k - 1$, where $k$ is the number of dimensions of the grid. In this case, we are considering a 2-dimensional grid (a plane), so $k = 2$. Therefore, the maximum $n$ is $2^2 - 1 = 3$.\n\n6. **Verification**: Let's verify this by considering the case $n = 3$.

(This is a well-known formula expressing the area of triangle $A B C$ when $A$ is the origin.)\n\nTo say that there exist integers $x, y$ for which $|u y-v x|=2 k$, is equivalent to saying that the greatest common divisor of $u$ and $v$ is also a divisor of $2 k$. Summing up, a point $B=(u, v) \\in S$ is a $k$-friend of $(0,0)$ if and only if $\\operatorname{gcd}(u, v)$ divides $2 k$.\n\nTranslation by a vector with integer coordinates does not affect $k$-friendship; if two points are $k$-friends, so are their translates. It follows that two points $A, B \\in S, A=(s, t), B=(u, v)$, are $k$-friends if and only if the point $(u-s, v-t)$ is a $k$-friend of $(0,0)$; i.e., if $\\operatorname{gcd}(u-s, v-t) \\mid 2 k$.\n\nLet $n$ be a positive integer which does not divide $2 k$. We claim that a $k$-clique cannot have more than $n^{2}$ elements.\n\nIndeed, all points $(x, y) \\in S$ can be divided into $n^{2}$ classes determined by the remainders that $x$ and $y$ leave in division by $n$. If a set $T$ has more than $n^{2}$ elements, some two points $A, B \\in T, A=(s, t), B=(u, v)$, necessarily fall into the same class. This means that $n \\mid u-s$ and $n \\mid v-t$. Hence $n \\mid d$ where $d=\\operatorname{gcd}(u-s, v-t)$. And since $n$ does not divide $2 k$, also $d$ does not divide $2 k$. Thus $A$ and $B$ are not $k$-friends and the set $T$ is not a $k$-clique.\n\nNow let $M(k)$ be the least positive integer which does not divide $2 k$. Write $M(k)=m$ for the moment and consider the set $T$ of all points $(x, y)$ with $0 \\leq x, y<m$. There are $m^{2}$ of them. If $A=(s, t), B=(u, v)$ are two distinct points in $T$ then both differences $|u-s|,|v-t|$ are integers less than $m$ and at least one of them is positive. By the definition of $m$, every positive integer less than $m$ divides $2 k$. Therefore $u-s$ (if nonzero) divides $2 k$, and the same is true of $v-t$. So $2 k$ is divisible by $\\operatorname{gcd}(u-s, v-t)$, meaning that $A, B$ are $k$-friends. Thus $T$ is a $k$-clique.\n\nIt follows that the maximum size of a $k$-clique is $M(k)^{2}$, with $M(k)$ defined as above. We are looking for the minimum $k$ such that $M(k)^{2}>200$.\n\nBy the definition of $M(k), 2 k$ is divisible by the numbers $1,2, \\ldots, M(k)-1$, but not by $M(k)$ itself.

If, moreover, the process does not touch the lamps $n+1, \\ldots, 2 n$, it will be called restricted. So there are $N$ admissible processes, among which $M$ are restricted.\n\nIn every admissible process, restricted or not, each one of the lamps $1, \\ldots, n$ goes from off to on, so it is switched an odd number of times; and each one of the lamps $n+1, \\ldots, 2 n$ goes from off to off, so it is switched an even number of times.\n\nNotice that $M>0$; i.e., restricted admissible processes do exist (it suffices to switch each one of the lamps $1, \\ldots, n$ just once and then choose one of them and switch it $k-n$ times, which by hypothesis is an even number).\n\nConsider any restricted admissible process $\\mathbf{p}$. Take any lamp $\\ell, 1 \\leq \\ell \\leq n$, and suppose that it was switched $k_{\\ell}$ times. As noticed, $k_{\\ell}$ must be odd. Select arbitrarily an even number of these $k_{\\ell}$ switches and replace each of them by the switch of lamp $n+\\ell$. This can be done in $2^{k_{\\ell}-1}$ ways (because a $k_{\\ell}$-element set has $2^{k_{\\ell}-1}$ subsets of even cardinality). Notice that $k_{1}+\\cdots+k_{n}=k$.\n\nThese actions are independent, in the sense that the action involving lamp $\\ell$ does not affect the action involving any other lamp. So there are $2^{k_{1}-1} \\cdot 2^{k_{2}-1} \\cdots 2^{k_{n}-1}=2^{k-n}$ ways of combining these actions. In any of these combinations, each one of the lamps $n+1, \\ldots, 2 n$ gets switched an even number of times and each one of the lamps $1, \\ldots, n$ remains switched an odd number of times, so the final state is the same as that resulting from the original process $\\mathbf{p}$.\n\nThis shows that every restricted admissible process $\\mathbf{p}$ can be modified in $2^{k-n}$ ways, giving rise to $2^{k-n}$ distinct admissible processes (with all lamps allowed).\n\nNow we show that every admissible process $\\mathbf{q}$ can be achieved in that way. Indeed, it is enough to replace every switch of a lamp with a label $\\ell>n$ that occurs in $\\mathbf{q}$ by the switch of the corresponding lamp $\\ell-n$; in the resulting process $\\mathbf{p}$ the lamps $n+1, \\ldots, 2 n$ are not involved.\n\nSwitches of each lamp with a label $\\ell>n$ had occurred in $\\mathbf{q}$ an even number of times. So the performed replacements have affected each lamp with a label $\\ell \\leq n$ also an even number of times; hence in the overall effect the final state of each lamp has remained the same. This means that the resulting process $\\mathbf{p}$ is admissible - and clearly restricted, as the lamps $n+1, \\ldots, 2 n$ are not involved in it any more.\n\nIf we now take process $\\mathbf{p}$ and reverse all these replacements, then we obtain process $\\mathbf{q}$. These reversed replacements are nothing else than the modifications described in the foregoing paragraphs.\n\nThus there is a one-to- $\\left(2^{k-n}\\right)$ correspondence between the $M$ restricted admissible processes and the total of $N$ admissible processes.

Call the boxes of the two kinds red and white respectively. We claim that on her first move $A$ can achieve a regular distribution again, regardless of $B$ 's first move $M$. She acts according as the following situation $S$ occurs after $M$ or not: The initial distribution contains a red box $R$ with 2 white neighbors, and $R$ receives no coins from them on move $M$.\n\nSuppose that $S$ does not occur. Exactly one of the coins $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$ in a given red box $X$ is involved in $M$, say $c_{1}$. If $M$ passes $c_{1}$ to the right neighbor of $X$, let $A$ pass $c_{2}$ to its left neighbor, and vice versa. By doing so with all red boxes $A$ performs a legal move $M^{\\prime}$. Thus $M$ and $M^{\\prime}$ combined move the 2 coins of every red box in opposite directions. Hence after $M$ and $M^{\\prime}$ are complete each neighbor of a red box $X$ contains exactly 1 coin that was initially in $X$. So each box with a red neighbor is non-empty after $M^{\\prime}$. If initially there is a box $X$ with 2 white neighbors ( $X$ is red and unique) then $X$ receives a coin from at least one of them on move $M$ since $S$ does not occur. Such a coin is not involved in $M^{\\prime}$, so $X$ is also non-empty after $M^{\\prime}$. Furthermore each box $Y$ has given away its initial content after $M$ and $M^{\\prime}$. A red neighbor of $Y$ adds 1 coin to it; a white neighbor adds at most 1 coin because it is not involved in $M^{\\prime}$. Hence each box contains 1 or 2 coins after $M^{\\prime}$. Because $N=2 n-2$, such a distribution is regular.\n\nNow let $S$ occur after move $M$. Then $A$ leaves untouched the exceptional red box $R$. With all remaining red boxes she proceeds like in the previous case, thus making a legal move $M^{\\prime \\prime}$. Box $R$ receives no coins from its neighbors on either move, so there is 1 coin in it after $M^{\\prime \\prime}$. Like above $M$ and $M^{\\prime \\prime}$ combined pass exactly 1 coin from every red box different from $R$ to each of its neighbors. Every box except $R$ has a red neighbor different from $R$, hence all boxes are non-empty after $M^{\\prime \\prime}$. Next, each box $Y$ except $R$ loses its initial content after $M$ and $M^{\\prime \\prime}$. A red neighbor of $Y$ adds at most 1 coin to it; a white neighbor also adds at most 1 coin as it does not participate in $M^{\\prime \\prime}$. Thus each box has 1 or 2 coins after $M^{\\prime \\prime}$, and the obtained distribution is regular.\n\nPlayer $A$ can apply the described strategy indefinitely, so $N=2 n-2$ enables her to succeed.\n\nb) For $N \\leq 2 n-3$ player $B$ can achieve an empty box after some move of $A$.

Note that $\\ell \\geq 2$ by the last condition. Moreover if both extremes of $\\alpha$ are non-empty boxes then $N(\\alpha) \\geq 2$, so that $N(\\alpha) \\leq 2 \\ell-3$ implies $\\ell \\geq 3$. Observe also that if an extreme $X$ of $\\alpha$ has more than 1 coin then ignoring $X$ yields a shorter arc. It follows that every arc contains an arc whose extremes have at most 1 coin each.\n\nGiven a clockwise labeling $1,2, \\ldots, n$ of the boxes, suppose that boxes $1,2, \\ldots, \\ell$ form an arc $\\alpha$, with $\\ell \\leq n-2$ and $N(\\alpha) \\leq 2 \\ell-3$. Suppose also that all $n \\geq 7$ boxes are non-empty. Then $B$ can move so that an arc $\\alpha^{\\prime}$ with $N\\left(\\alpha^{\\prime}\\right)<N(\\alpha)$ will appear after any response of $A$.\n\n\n\nOne may assume exactly 1 coin in boxes 1 and $\\ell$ by a previous remark. Let $B$ pass 1 coin in counterclockwise direction from box 1 and box $n$, and in clockwise direction from each remaining box. This leaves $N(\\alpha)-2$ coins in the boxes of $\\alpha$.

Moreover, give a positive integer $n$ the $i$-th color if $n \\equiv i(3)$.\n\nBy construction we have $f(1+2)=6 \\neq 3=f(1)+f(2)$ and hence $f$ has property (ii).\n\nNow let $n, m$ be positive integers with the same color $i$. If $i=0$, then $n+m$ has color 0 , so $f(n+m)=$ $2(n+m)=2 n+2 m=f(n)+f(m)$. If $i=1$, then $n+m$ has color 2 , so $f(n+m)=n+m=f(n)+f(m)$. Finally, if $i=2$, then $n+m$ has color 1 , so $f(n+m)=n+m=f(n)+f(m)$. Therefore $f$ also satisfies condition (i).\n\nNext we show that there is no such function and coloring for $k=2$.\n\nConsider any coloring of $\\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ with 2 colors and any function $f: \\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ satisfying conditions (i) and (ii). Then there exist positive integers $m$ and $n$ such that $f(m+n) \\neq f(m)+f(n)$. Choose $m$ and $n$ such that their sum is minimal among all such $m, n$ and define $a=m+n$. Then in particular for every $b<a$ we have $f(b)=b f(1)$ and $f(a) \\neq a f(1)$.\n\nIf $a$ is even, then condition (i) for $m=n=\\frac{a}{2}$ implies $f(a)=f\\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)+f\\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)=f(1) a$, a contradiction. Hence $a$ is odd. We will prove two lemmas.\n\nLemma 1. Any odd integer $b<a$ has a different color than $a$.\n\nProof. Suppose that $b<a$ is an odd integer, and that $a$ and $b$ have the same color. Then on the one hand, $f(a+b)=f(a)+b f(1)$. On the other hand, we also have $f(a+b)=f\\left(\\frac{a+b}{2}\\right)+f\\left(\\frac{a+b}{2}\\right)=(a+b) f(1)$, as $\\frac{a+b}{2}$ is a positive integer smaller than $a$. Hence $f(a)=f(a+b)-b f(1)=(a+b) f(1)-b f(1)=a f(1)$, which is again a contradiction. Therefore all odd integers smaller than $a$ have a color different from that of $a$.\n\nLemma 2. Any even integer $b<a$ has the same color as a\n\nProof. Suppose $b<a$ is an even integer, and that $a$ and $b$ have different colors. Then $a-b$ is an odd integer smaller than $a$, so it has the same color as $b$. Thus $f(a)=f(a-b)+f(b)=(a-b) f(1)+b f(1)=a f(1)$, a contradiction. Hence all even integers smaller than $a$ have the same color as $a$.\n\nSuppose now $a+1$ has the same color as $a$. As $a>1$, we have $\\frac{a+1}{2}<a$ and therefore $f(a+1)=2 f\\left(\\frac{a+1}{2}\\right)=$ $(a+1) f(1)$. As $a-1$ is an even integer smaller than $a$, we have by Lemma 2 that $a-1$ also has the same color as $a$. Hence $2 f(a)=f(2 a)=f(a+1)+f(a-1)=(a+1) f(1)+(a-1) f(1)=2 a f(1)$, which implies that $f(a)=a f(1)$, a contradiction. So $a$ and $a+1$ have different colors.\n\nSince $a-2$ is an odd integer smaller than $a$, by Lemma 1 it has a color different from that of $a$, so $a-2$ and $a+1$ have the same color. Also, we have seen by Lemma 2 that $a-1$ and $a$ have the same color. So $f(a)+f(a-1)=f(2 a-1)=f(a+1)+f(a-2)=(a+1) f(1)+(a-2) f(1)=(2 a-1) f(1)$, from which it follows that $f(a)=(2 a-1) f(1)-f(a-1)=(2 a-1) f(1)-(a-1) f(1)=a f(1)$, which contradicts our choice of $a$ and finishes the proof.", "We prove that $k \\leq 3$ just as in first solution.\n\nNext we show that there is no such function and coloring for $k=2$.\n\nConsider any coloring of $\\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ with 2 colors and any function $f: \\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ satisfying conditions (i) and (ii).

Then we have the relations\n\n$$\nf(2 n)=2 c, \\quad f(4 n)=4 c, \\quad f(6 n)=2 d\n$$\n\n- If $n$ and $2 n$ have the same color, then $f(3 n)=f(n)+f(2 n)=3 c=3 f(n)$.\n- If $n$ and $3 n$ have the same color, then $4 c=f(4 n)=f(n)+f(3 n)=c+f(3 n)$, so $f(3 n)=3 f(n)$.\n- If $2 n$ and $4 n$ have the same color, then $2 d=f(6 n)=f(2 n)+f(4 n)=2 c+4 c=6 c$, so $f(3 n)=d=3 c$.\n- Otherwise $n$ and $4 n$ have the same color, and $2 n$ and $3 n$ both have the opposite color to $n$. Therefore we compute $5 c=f(n)+f(4 n)=f(5 n)=f(2 n)+f(3 n)=2 c+f(3 n)$ so $f(3 n)=3 f(n)$.\n\nConsequently, for $k=2$ we necessarily have $f(3 n)=3 f(n)$.\n\nNow let $a$ be the smallest integer such that $f(a) \\neq a f(1)$.

It is clearly true for $l=0$. If $x+l m$ is black and satisfies $f(x+l m)=$ $f(x)+l f(m)$, then $f(x+(l+1) m)=f(x+l m)+f(m)=f(x)+(l+1) f(m)$ and $f(x+(l+1) m+n)=$ $f(x+l m)+f(m+n)=f(x)+l f(m)+f(m+n) \\neq f(x)+(l+1) f(m)+f(n)=f(x+(l+1) m)+f(n)$, so $x+(l+1) m$ is not the same color of $n$, therefore $x+(l+1) m$ is black. Thjs completes the induction.\n\nIn particular we then must have that $2^{l} n$ is white for every $l$, because otherwise since $2^{l} m$ is black we would have $2^{l} f(m+n)=f\\left(2^{l} m+2^{l} n\\right)=f\\left(2^{l} m\\right)+f\\left(2^{l} n\\right)=2^{l}(f(m)+f(n))$, and consequently $f(m+n)=$ $f(m)+f(n)$.\n\nLemma 5.

On the other hand we have\n\n$\\left.2^{l} f(m+n)=2^{l-1} \\cdot 2 f(m+n) \\neq 2^{l-1}(f(m+n)+f(m)+f(n))=2^{l-1}(f(2 m+n)+f(n))=f\\left(2^{l} m+2^{l-1} n\\right)\\right)+f\\left(2^{l-1} n\\right)$.\n\nTherefore $2^{l} m+2^{l-1} n$ and $2^{l-1} n$ have different color, which means $2^{l} m+2^{l-1} n$ is black.\n\nCombining the two lemmas give $j m+2^{l-1} n$ is black for all $j \\geq 2^{l}$ and every $l \\geq 1$.\n\nNow write $m=2^{l-1} m^{\\prime}$ with $m^{\\prime}$ odd.

Let's denote the colours by $C_1, C_2, \\ldots, C_k$.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Function $f$\nFor the function $f$ to satisfy the functional equation, it must be of the form $f(x) = cx$ for some constant $c$. However, since $f$ maps to positive integers, $c$ must be a positive integer.\n\n### Step 4: Ensuring the Function $f$ Satisfies Property (ii)\nProperty (ii) states that there exist positive integers $m, n$ such that $f(m+n) \\neq f(m) + f(n)$. This implies that $f$ cannot be a linear function of the form $f(x) = cx$ for all $x$.\n\n### Step 5: Finding the Smallest $k$\nTo satisfy property (ii), we need to find a colouring such that there are integers of different colours for which the functional equation does not hold. This means that for some $m$ and $n$ of different colours, $f(m+n) \\neq f(m) + f(n)$.\n\nLet's consider the smallest possible $k$:\n- If $k = 1$, then all integers are of the same colour. This trivially satisfies property (i) but not property (ii) because $f(m+n) = f(m) + f(n)$ for all $m, n$.\n- If $k = 2$, we can color the integers as follows:\n  - Integers of the form $2^a$ (where $a$ is a non-negative integer) are colored with colour $C_1$.\n  - All other integers are colored with colour $C_2$.\n\nNow, let's check if this coloring satisfies property (ii):\n- For $m = 2^a$ and $n = 2^b$ (where $a \\neq b$), $f(m+n) = f(2^{a+b}) = 2^{a+b}$.\n- For $f(m) + f(n) = f(2^a) + f(2^b) = 2^a + 2^b$.\n\nClearly, $2^{a+b} \\neq 2^a + 2^b$ for $a \\neq b$.

Indeed, if one of the sides the square had three rectangles adjacent to it, removing these three rectangles would leave a polygon with eight vertices, which is clearly not the union of two rectangles. Moreover, since $m>10$, each side of the square has at least two adjacent rectangles. Hence each side of the square has precisely two adjacent rectangles, and thus the only way of partitionning the square into five rectangles is to have a single inner rectangle and four outer rectangles each covering of the four corners of the square, as claimed.\n\nLet us now show that a square of size $12 \\times 12$ cannot be dissected in the desired way. Let $R_{1}, R_{2}, R_{3}$ and $R_{4}$ be the outer rectangles (in clockwise orientation along the\n\n\n\nboundary of the square). If an outer rectangle has a side of length $s$, then some adjacent outer rectangle must have a side of length $12-s$. Therefore, neither of $s=1$ or $s=6$ can be sidelengths of an outer rectangle, so the inner rectangle must have dimensions $1 \\times 6$. One of the outer rectangles (say $R_{1}$ ) must have dimensions $10 \\times x$, and an adjacent rectangle (say $R_{2}$ ) must thus have dimensions $2 \\times y$. Rectangle $R_{3}$ then has dimensions $(12-y) \\times z$, and rectangle $R_{4}$ has dimensions $(12-z) \\times(12-x)$. Note that exactly one of the three numbers $x, y, z$ is even (and equals 4 or 8 ), while the other two numbers are odd. Now, the total area of all five rectangles is\n\n$$\n144=6+10 x+2 y+(12-y) z+(12-z)(12-x)\n$$\n\nwhich simplifies to $(y-x)(z-2)=6$. As exactly one of the three numbers $x, y, z$ is even, the factors $y-x$ and $z-2$ are either both even or both odd, so their product cannot equal 6 , and thus there is no solution with $m=12$.\n\nFinally, we handle the cases $m=11$ and $m=13$, which indeed are solutions. The corresponding rectangle sets are $10 \\times 5,1 \\times 9,8 \\times 2,7 \\times 4$ and $3 \\times 6$ for $m=11$, and $10 \\times 5,9 \\times 8,4 \\times 6,3 \\times 7$ and $1 \\times 2$ for $m=13$.

Consider the set of all length- $k$ strings containing only $A \\mathrm{~s}$ and $B \\mathrm{~s}$ which end with a $B$, and remove the string consisting of $k$  $B \\mathrm{~s}$. Clearly there are 2 independent choices for each of the first $k-1$ letters and 1 for the last letter, and since exactly one string is excluded, there must be exactly $2^{k-1}-1$ strings in this set.\n\nSuppose Lexi tries to fill her grid. For each row to have a valid string, it must end in a $B$. But then the right column would necessarily contain $k B \\mathrm{~s}$, and not be in our set. Thus, Lexi cannot fill her grid with our set, and we must have $m \\geqslant 2^{k-1}$.\n\nNow, consider any set $\\mathcal{S}$ with at least $2^{k-1}$ strings. Clearly, if $\\mathcal{S}$ contained either the uniform string with $k A \\mathrm{~s}$ or the string with $k B \\mathrm{~s}$, then Lexi could fill her grid with all of the relevant letters and each row and column would contain that string.\n\nConsider the case where $\\mathcal{S}$ contains neither of those strings. Among all $2^{k}$ possible length$k$ strings with $A \\mathrm{~s}$ and $B \\mathrm{~s}$, each has a complement which corresponds to the string with $B$ s in every position where first string had $A$ s and vice-versa. Clearly, the string with all $A$ s is paired with the string with all $B$ s. We may assume that we do not take the two uniform strings and thus applying the pigeonhole principle to the remaining set of strings, we must have two strings which are complementary.\n\nLet this pair of strings be $\\ell, \\ell^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{S}$ in some order. Define the set of indices $\\mathcal{J}$ corresponding to the $A \\mathrm{~s}$ in $\\ell$ and thus the $B \\mathrm{~s}$ in $\\ell^{\\prime}$, and all other indices (not in $\\mathcal{J}$ ) correspond to $B \\mathrm{~s}$ in $\\ell$ (and thus $A$ s in $\\ell^{\\prime}$ ). Then, we claim that Lexi puts an $A$ in the cell in row $r$, column $c$ if $r, c \\in \\mathcal{J}$ or $r, c \\notin \\mathcal{J}$, and a $B$ otherwise, each row and column contains a string in $\\mathcal{S}$.\n\nWe illustrate this with a simple example: If $k=6$ and we have that $A A A B A B$ and $B B B A B A$ are both in the dictionary, then Lexi could fill the table as follows:\n\n| A | A | A | B | A | B |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| A | A | A | B | A | B |\n| A | A | A | B | A | B |\n| B | B | B | A | B | A |\n| A | A | A | B | A | B |\n| B | B | B | A | B | A |\n\nSuppose we are looking at row $i$ or column $i$ for $i \\in \\mathcal{J}$. Then by construction the string in this row/column contains $A \\mathrm{~s}$ at indices $k$ with $k \\in \\mathcal{J}$ and $B$ s elsewhere, and thus is precisely $\\ell$. Suppose instead we are looking at row $i$ or column $i$ for $i \\notin \\mathcal{J}$. Then again by construction the string in this row/column contains $A$ s at indices $k$ with $k \\notin \\mathcal{J}$ and $B$ s elsewhere, and thus is precisely $\\ell^{\\prime}$. So each row and column indeed contains a string in $\\mathcal{S}$.\n\nThus, for any $\\mathcal{S}$ with $|\\mathcal{S}| \\geqslant 2^{k-1}$, Lexi can definitely fill the grid appropriately.

If we had not seen this, we could have used the quadratic formula.)\n\nTherefore, for $y=5-k$ to give points on the circle, we need $-5 \\leq 5-k$ and $5-k \\leq 5$.\n\nThis gives $k \\leq 10$ and $k \\geq 0$.\n\nSince $k$ is a positive integer, the possible values of $k$ to this point are $k=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10$.\n\nIf $k=1$, then $y=5-1=4$. In this case, $x^{2}+4^{2}=25$ or $x^{2}=9$ and so $x= \\pm 3$.\n\nThis gives the two points $(3,4)$ and $(-3,4)$ which lie on the parabola and circle.\n\nConsider the three points $A(3,4), B(-3,4)$ and $C(0,-5)$.\n\nNow $A B$ is horizontal with $A B=3-(-3)=6$. (This is the difference in $x$-coordinates.) The vertical distance from $A B$ to $C$ is $4-(-5)=9$.

Thus, $s_{1}=a_{1}+a_{2}$.\n\nSimilarly, the largest sum must be the sum of the two largest numbers, and so $s_{6}=a_{3}+a_{4}$. Since $a_{1} \\leq a_{2} \\leq a_{3} \\leq a_{4}$, then the second smallest sum is $a_{1}+a_{3}$.

Since a total of five 1s are used, then each arrangement corresponds with an integer with $n$ digits whose digits have a sum of 5 . Therefore, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the integers and arrangements with the desired properties.\n\nThus, $f(n)$, which equals the number of such integers, also equals the number of such arrangements.\n\nTo count the number of such arrangements, we note that there are four 1 s and $n-1 \\mathrm{Xs}$ to arrange in the final $4+(n-1)=n+3$ positions, since the first position is occupied by a 1 .\n\nThere are $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+3 \\\\ 4\\end{array}\\right)$ ways to choose the positions of the remaining four 1s, and so $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+3 \\\\ 4\\end{array}\\right)$ arrangements.\n\nThus, $f(n)=\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+3 \\\\ 4\\end{array}\\right)=\\frac{(n+3) !}{4 !(n-1) !}=\\frac{(n+3)(n+2)(n+1)(n)}{4 !}=\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{24}$.\n\nNext, we need to determine the positive integers $n$ between 1 and 2014, inclusive, for which the units digit of $f(n)$ is 1 .\n\nNow $f(n)=\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{24}$ is an integer for all positive integers $n$, since it is counting the number of things with a certain property.\n\nIf the units digit of $n$ is 0 or 5 , then $n$ is a multiple of 5 .\n\nIf the units digit of $n$ is 2 or 7 , then $n+3$ is a multiple of 5 .\n\nIf the units digit of $n$ is 3 or 8 , then $n+2$ is a multiple of 5 .\n\nIf the units digit of $n$ is 4 or 9 , then $n+1$ is a multiple of 5 .\n\nThus, if the units digit of $n$ is $0,2,3,4,5,7,8$, or 9 , then $n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)$\n\nis a multiple of 5 and so $f(n)=\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{24}$ is a multiple of 5 , since the denominator contains no factors of 5 that can divide the factor from the numerator.\n\nTherefore, if the units digit of $n$ is $0,2,3,4,5,7,8$, or 9 , then $f(n)$ is divisible by 5 , and so cannot have a units digit of 1 .\n\nSo we consider the cases where $n$ has a units digit of 1 or of 6 ; these are the only possible values of $n$ for which $f(n)$ can have a units digit of 1 .\n\nWe note that $3 f(n)=\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{8}$, which is a positive integer for all positive integers $n$.\n\n\n\nAlso, we note that if $f(n)$ has units digit 1 , then $3 f(n)$ has units digit 3 , and if $3 f(n)$ has units digit 3 , then $f(n)$ must have units digit 1 .\n\nTherefore, determining the values of $n$ for which $f(n)$ has units digit 1 is equivalent to determining the values of $n$ for which $\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{8}$ has units digit 3 .\n\nWe consider the integers $n$ in groups of 40 .

Since $0<a \\leq b \\leq c$, then $b<a+c$ and $a<b+c$ follow automatically, so only $c<a+b$ ever needs to be checked.\n\nInstead of directly considering triangles and sets of triangle, we can consider triples $(a, b, c)$ and sets of triples $(a, b, c)$ with the appropriate conditions.\n\nFor each positive integer $k \\geq 3$, we use the notation $S_{k}$ to denote the set of triples of positive integers $(a, b, c)$ with $0<a \\leq b \\leq c$ and $c<a+b$ and $a+b+c=k$.\n\nIn this case, $c<a+b$ and $a+b+c=k$, so $c+c<a+b+c=k$, so $2 c<k$ or $c<\\frac{1}{2} k$.\n\nAlso, if $0<a \\leq b \\leq c$ and $a+b+c=k$, then $k=a+b+c \\leq c+c+c$, so $3 c \\geq k$ or $c \\geq \\frac{1}{3} k$.\n\n\nWe will use two important facts:\n\n(F1) $T(2 m)=T(2 m-3)$ for every positive integer $m \\geq 3$, and\n\n(F2) $T(k) \\leq T(k+2)$ for every positive integer $k \\geq 3$\n\nFirst, we prove (F1):\n\n\nWe show that $T(2 m)=T(2 m-3)$ by creating a one-to-one correspondence between the triples in $S_{2 m}$ and the triples $S_{2 m-3}$.\n\nNote that $S_{2 m}$ is the set of triples $(a, b, c)$ of positive integers with $0<a \\leq b \\leq c$, with $c<a+b$, and with $a+b+c=2 m$.\n\nAlso, $S_{2 m-3}$ is the set of triples $(A, B, C)$ of positive integers with $0<A \\leq B \\leq C$, with $C<A+B$, and with $A+B+C=2 m-3$.\n\nConsider a triple $(a, b, c)$ in $S_{2 m}$ and a corresponding triple $(a-1, b-1, c-1)$.\n\nWe show that $(a-1, b-1, c-1)$ is in $S_{2 m-3}$ :\n\n* Since $(a, b, c)$ is in $S_{2 m}$, then $c<\\frac{1}{2}(2 m)=m$. This means that $b \\leq c \\leq m-1$, so $a=2 m-b-c \\geq 2$. Therefore, $a-1, b-1$ and $c-1$ are positive integers since $a, b$ and $c$ are positive integers with $2 \\leq a \\leq b \\leq c$.\n* Since $2 \\leq a \\leq b \\leq c$, then $1 \\leq a-1 \\leq b-1 \\leq c-1$, so $0<a-1 \\leq b-1 \\leq c-1$.\n* Since $a+b+c=2 m$, then $c=2 m-(a+b)$ so $a+b$ and $c$ have the same parity.\n\nSince $c<a+b$, then $c \\leq a+b-2$. (In other words, it cannot be the case that $c=a+b-1$.) Therefore, $c-1 \\leq(a-1)+(b-1)-1$; that is, $c-1<(a-1)+(b-1)$.\n\n$*$ Since $a+b+c=2 m$, then $(a-1)+(b-1)+(c-1)=2 m-3$.\n\nTherefore, $(a-1, b-1, c-1)$ is in $S_{2 m-3}$, since it satisfies all of the conditions of $S_{2 m-3}$. Note as well that two different triples in $S_{2 m}$ correspond to two different triples in $S_{2 m-3}$. Thus, every triple in $S_{2 m}$ corresponds to a different triple in $S_{2 m-3}$.\n\nThus, $T(2 m) \\leq T(2 m-3)$.\n\nConsider a triple $(A, B, C)$ in $S_{2 m-3}$ and a corresponding triple $(A+1, B+1, C+1)$. We show that $(A+1, B+1, C+1)$ is in $S_{2 m}$ :\n\n* Since $(A, B, C)$ is in $S_{2 m-3}$, then $A, B$ and $C$ are positive integers, so $A+1, B+1$ and $C+1$ are positive integers.\n* Since $0<A \\leq B \\leq C$, then $1<A+1 \\leq B+1 \\leq C+1$, so $0<A+1 \\leq B+1 \\leq C+1$.\n* Since $C<A+B$, then $C+1<(A+1)+(B+1)-1$ so $C+1<(A+1)+(B+1)$.\n* Since $A+B+C=2 m-3$, then $(A+1)+(B+1)+(C+1)=2 m$.\n\nTherefore, $(A+1, B+1, C+1)$ is in $S_{2 m}$.\n\nNote again that two different triples in $S_{2 m-3}$ correspond to two different triples in $S_{2 m}$. Thus, every triple in $S_{2 m-3}$ corresponds to a different triple in $S_{2 m}$.\n\nTherefore, $T(2 m-3) \\leq T(2 m)$.\n\nSince $T(2 m) \\leq T(2 m-3)$ and $T(2 m-3) \\leq T(2 m)$, then $T(2 m)=T(2 m-3)$.\n\n\nNext, we prove (F2):\n\nConsider a triple $(a, b, c)$ in $S_{k}$ and a corresponding triple $(a, b+1, c+1)$. We show that the triple $(a, b+1, c+1)$ is in $S_{k+2}$ :\n\n* Since $a, b$ and $c$ are positive integers, then $a, b+1$ and $c+1$ are positive integers.\n\n\n\n* Since $0<a \\leq b \\leq c$, then $0<a \\leq b+1 \\leq c+1$.\n* Since $c<a+b$, then $c+1<a+(b+1)$.\n\n$*$ Since $a+b+c=k$, then $a+(b+1)+(c+1)=k+2$.\n\nTherefore, $(a, b+1, c+1)$ is in $S_{k+2}$. Note that, using this correspondence, different triples in $S_{k}$ correspond different triples in $S_{k+2}$. Thus, every triple in $S_{k}$ corresponds to a different triple in $S_{k+2}$. This proves that $T(k) \\leq T(k+2)$.\n\nSuppose that $n=N$ is the smallest positive integer for which $T(n)>2010$.\n\nThen $N$ must be odd:\n\nIf $N$ was even, then by (F1), $T(N-3)=T(N)>2010$ and so $n=N-3$ would be an integer smaller than $N$ with $T(n)>2010$. This contradicts the fact that $n=N$ is the smallest such integer.\n\nTherefore, we want to find the smallest odd positive integer $N$ for which $T(N)>2010$. Next, we note that if we can find an odd positive integer $n$ such that $T(n)>2010 \\geq$ $T(n-2)$, then we will have found the desired value of $n$ :\n\nThis is because $n$ and $n-2$ are both odd, and by property (F2), any smaller odd positive integer $k$ will give $T(k) \\leq T(n-2) \\leq 2010$ and any larger odd positive integer $m$ will give $T(m) \\geq T(n)>2010$.\n\nWe show that $N=309$ is the desired value of $N$ by showing that $T(309)>2010$ and $T(307) \\leq 2010$.\n\nCalculation of $T(309)$\n\nWe know that $\\frac{309}{3} \\leq c<\\frac{309}{2}$, so $103 \\leq c \\leq 154$.\n\nFor each admissible value of $c$, we need to count the number of pairs of positive integers $(a, b)$ with $a \\leq b \\leq c$ and $a+b=309-c$.\n\nFor example, if $c=154$, then we need $a \\leq b \\leq 154$ and $a+b=155$.\n\nThis gives pairs $(1,154),(2,153), \\ldots,(76,79),(77,78)$, of which there are 77 .\n\nAlso, if $c=153$, then we need $a \\leq b \\leq 153$ and $a+b=156$.\n\nThis gives pairs $(3,153), \\ldots,(77,79),(78,78)$, of which there are 76 .\n\nIn general, if $c$ is even, then the minimum possible value of $a$ occurs when $b$ is as large as possible - that is, when $b=c$, so $a \\geq 309-2 c$.\n\nAlso, the largest possible value of $a$ occurs when $a$ and $b$ are as close to equal as possible. Since $c$ is even, then $309-c$ is odd, so $a$ and $b$ cannot be equal, but they can differ by 1 . In this case, $a=154-\\frac{1}{2} c$ and $b=155-\\frac{1}{2} c$.\n\nTherefore, if $c$ is even, there are $\\left(154-\\frac{1}{2} c\\right)-(309-2 c)+1=\\frac{3}{2} c-154$ possible pairs $(a, b)$ and so $\\frac{3}{2} c-154$ possible triples.\n\nIn general, if $c$ is odd, then the minimum possible value of $a$ occurs when $b$ is as large as possible - that is, when $b=c$, so $a \\geq 309-2 c$.\n\nAlso, the largest possible value of $a$ occurs when $a$ and $b$ are as close to equal as possible.\n\nSince $c$ is odd, then $309-c$ is even, so $a$ and $b$ can be equal. In this case, $a=\\frac{1}{2}(309-c)$. Therefore, if $c$ is odd, there are $\\frac{1}{2}(309-c)-(309-2 c)+1=\\frac{3}{2} c-\\frac{307}{2}$ possible pairs $(a, b)$ and so $\\frac{3}{2} c-\\frac{307}{2}$ possible triples.\n\nThe possible even values of $c$ are 104,106,...,152,154 (there are 26 such values) and the possible odd values of $c$ are 103,105,...,151,153 (there are 26 such values).\n\n\n\nTherefore,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nT(309)= & \\left(\\frac{3}{2}(104)-154\\right)+\\left(\\frac{3}{2}(106)-154\\right)+\\cdots+\\left(\\frac{3}{2}(154)-154\\right)+ \\\\\n& \\quad\\left(\\frac{3}{2}(103)-\\frac{307}{2}\\right)+\\left(\\frac{3}{2}(105)-\\frac{307}{2}\\right)+\\cdots+\\left(\\frac{3}{2}(153)-\\frac{307}{2}\\right) \\\\\n= & \\frac{3}{2}(104+106+\\cdots+154)-26 \\cdot 154+\\frac{3}{2}(103+105+\\cdots+153)-26 \\cdot \\frac{307}{2} \\\\\n= & \\frac{3}{2}(103+104+105+106+\\cdots+153+154)-26 \\cdot 154-26 \\cdot \\frac{307}{2} \\\\\n= & \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}(103+154)(52)-26 \\cdot 154-26 \\cdot \\frac{307}{2} \\\\\n= & \\frac{3}{2}(26)(257)-26 \\cdot 154-26 \\cdot \\frac{307}{2} \\\\\n= & 2028\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTherefore, $T(309)>2010$, as required.\n\nCalculation of $T(307)$\n\nWe know that $\\frac{307}{3} \\leq c<\\frac{307}{2}$, so $103 \\leq c \\leq 153$.\n\nFor each admissible value of $c$, we need to count the number of pairs of positive integers $(a, b)$ with $a \\leq b \\leq c$ and $a+b=307-c$.\n\nThis can be done in a similar way to the calculation of $T(309)$ above.\n\nIf $n$ is even, there are $\\frac{3}{2} c-153$ possible triples.\n\nIf $n$ is odd, there are $\\frac{3}{2} c-\\frac{305}{2}$ possible triples.\n\nThe possible even values of $c$ are $104,106, \\ldots, 150,152$ (there are 25 such values) and the possible odd values of $c$ are $103,105, \\ldots, 151,153$ (there are 26 such values).\n\nTherefore,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nT(307)= & \\left(\\frac{3}{2}(104)-153\\right)+\\left(\\frac{3}{2}(106)-153\\right)+\\cdots+\\left(\\frac{3}{2}(152)-153\\right)+ \\\\\n& \\quad\\left(\\frac{3}{2}(103)-\\frac{305}{2}\\right)+\\left(\\frac{3}{2}(105)-\\frac{305}{2}\\right)+\\cdots+\\left(\\frac{3}{2}(153)-\\frac{305}{2}\\right) \\\\\n= & \\frac{3}{2}(104+106+\\cdots+152)-25 \\cdot 153+\\frac{3}{2}(103+105+\\cdots+153)-26 \\cdot \\frac{305}{2} \\\\\n= & \\frac{3}{2}(103+104+105+106+\\cdots+152+153)-25 \\cdot 153-26 \\cdot \\frac{305}{2} \\\\\n= & \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}(103+153)(51)-25 \\cdot 153-26 \\cdot \\frac{305}{2} \\\\\n= & \\frac{3}{2}(51)(128)-25 \\cdot 153-26 \\cdot \\frac{305}{2} \\\\\n= & 2002\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTherefore, $T(307)<2010$, as required.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $T(n)>2010$ is $n=309$.\n\nAs a final note, we discuss briefly how one could guess that the answer was near $N=309$.\n\nConsider the values of $T(n)$ for small odd positive integers $n$.\n\nIn (a), by considering the possible values of $c$ from smallest (roughly $\\frac{1}{3} n$ ) to largest (roughly $\\frac{1}{2} n$ ), we saw that $T(11)=1+3=4$.\n\nIf we continue to calculate $T(n)$ for a few more small odd values of $n$ we will see that:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& T(13)=2+3=5 \\\\\n& T(15)=1+2+4=7 \\\\\n& T(17)=1+3+4=8 \\\\\n& T(19)=2+3+5=10 \\\\\n& T(21)=1+2+4+5=12 \\\\\n& T(23)=1+3+4+6=14\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n\n\nThe pattern that seems to emerge is that for $n$ odd, $T(n)$ is roughly equal to the sum of the integers from 1 to $\\frac{1}{4} n$, with one out of every three integers removed.

Note that every $\\operatorname{ESE}(2 k-1)$ is an $\\operatorname{ESE}(2 k)$.\n\nTherefore, the number of sequences in this case is $A(2 k-1)$.\n\nThus, $A(2 k)=A(2 k-1)+B(2 k-1)$.\n\n(iv) $\\operatorname{An} \\operatorname{ESO}(2 k+1)$ is either the one term sequence $2 k+1$, or includes $2 k+1$ and more terms, or does not include $2 k+1$.\n\nThere is 1 sequence of the first kind.\n\nAs in (iii), there are $A(2 k)$ sequences of the second kind and $B(2 k)$ sequences of the third kind.\n\nThus, $B(2 k+1)=1+A(2 k)+B(2 k)$.\n\nCombining these facts, for each positive integer $k$, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ne(2 k+1) & =A(2 k+1)+B(2 k+1) \\\\\n& =A(2 k)+(A(2 k)+B(2 k)+1) \\\\\n& =(A(2 k)+B(2 k))+A(2 k)+1 \\\\\n& =e(2 k)+(A(2 k-1)+B(2 k-1))+1 \\\\\n& =e(2 k)+e(2 k-1)+1\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ne(2 k) & =A(2 k)+B(2 k) \\\\\n& =(A(2 k-1)+B(2 k-1))+B(2 k-1) \\\\\n& =e(2 k-1)+(A(2 k-2)+B(2 k-2)+1) \\\\\n& =e(2 k-1)+e(2 k-2)+1\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTherefore, for all positive integers $n \\geq 3$, we have $e(n)=e(n-1)+e(n-2)+1$, as required.\n\n\n\nMethod 2 \n\nLet $n$ be a positive integer with $n \\geq 3$, and consider the $\\operatorname{ES}(n)$.\n\nWe divide the sequences into three sets:\n\n(i) The sequence 1 (there is 1 such sequence)\n\n(ii) The sequences which begin with 1 and have more than 1 term\n\n(iii) The sequences which do not begin with 1\n\nWe show that in case (ii) there are $e(n-1)$ sequences and in case (iii) there are $e(n-2)$ sequences.

Each of the resulting sequences is distinct, includes numbers from the set $\\{1,2,3, \\ldots, n-1\\}$, is increasing, and has odd terms in odd positions and even terms in even positions (since each term has been reduced by 1).

Since each sequence in $T$ does not begin with 1 , then the minimum number in each sequence is 3 .\n\nThus, each of the sequences in $T$ includes numbers from the set $\\{3,4, \\ldots, n\\}$, is increasing, and has odd terms in odd positions and even terms in even positions.\n\nThe sequences in $T$ are in a one-to-one correspondence with the $\\mathrm{ES}(n-2)$ (we call this set of sequences $U$ ) and so there are exactly $e(n-2)$ of them.\n\nWe can show that this one-to-one correspondence exists by subtracting 2 from each term of each sequence in $T$, to form a set of sequences $V$. Each of the resulting sequences is distinct, includes numbers from the set $\\{1,2,3, \\ldots, n-2\\}$, is increasing, and has odd terms in odd positions and even terms in even positions (since each term has been reduced by 2). Also, each sequence in $U$ can be obtained in this way (since adding 2 to each term in one of these $\\mathrm{ES}$ gives a distinct sequence in $U$ ).\n\nTherefore, the number of sequences in this case is $e(n-2)$.\n\nThis concludes our proof and shows that $e(n)=1+e(n-1)+e(n-2)$, as required."], "answer_type": "Numerical", "subfield": "Combinatorics", "code": ["To determine $e(18)$ and $e(19)$, we need to understand the pattern and recurrence relation for $e(N)$. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nAn Eden sequence from $\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, N\\}$ must satisfy the following conditions:\n1. Each term is an element of the set $\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, N\\}$.\n2. The sequence is increasing.\n3. The terms in odd numbered positions are odd, and the terms in even numbered positions are even.\n\n### Step 2: Recurrence Relation\nTo find a recurrence relation for $e(N)$, consider the last term of an Eden sequence. If the last term is $k$, then the sequence before the last term must be an Eden sequence from $\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, k-1\\}$. The number of such sequences is $e(k-1)$. Since $k$ can be any odd or even number from 1 to $N$, we need to count the number of valid sequences for each possible last term.\n\n### Step 3: Counting Valid Sequences\nFor each $k$ from 1 to $N$, we need to count the number of valid Eden sequences that end with $k$. If $k$ is odd, the sequence before $k$ must be an Eden sequence from $\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, k-1\\}$, and if $k$ is even, the sequence before $k$ must be an Eden sequence from $\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, k-1\\}$.\n\n### Step 4: Summing Up\nThe total number of Eden sequences from $\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, N\\}$ is the sum of the number of valid sequences that end with each possible last term. This gives us the recurrence relation:\n\\[ e(N) = e(N-1) + e(N-2) + \\cdots + e(1) \\]\n\n### Step 5: Calculating $e(18)$ and $e(19)$\nGiven $e(17) = 4180$ and $e(20) = 17710$, we can use the recurrence relation to find $e(18)$ and $e(19)$.\n\n#### Calculating $e(18)$\n\\[ e(18) = e(17) + e(16) + e(15) + \\cdots + e(1) \\]\nWe need to find $e(16)$, $e(15)$, and so on.

We need to determine the coefficients \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) such that \\( g \\) is tenuous.\n\n### Step 5: Ensuring Tenuous Property\nFor \\( g(x) = ax + b \\), the tenuous property becomes:\n\\[ (ax + b) + (ay + b) > x^2 \\]\n\\[ ax + ay + 2b > x^2 \\]\n\\[ a(x + y) + 2b > x^2 \\]\n\nTo satisfy this for all \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), we need:\n\\[ a(x + y) + 2b > x^2 \\]\nThis implies that \\( a \\) must be positive and large enough to ensure the inequality holds for all \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\n### Step 6: Minimizing the Sum\nTo minimize the sum \\( g(1) + g(2) + \\cdots + g(20) \\), we need to minimize \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). Let's start with \\( a = 1 \\) and find \\( b \\).\n\n### Step 7: Calculating \\( g(14) \\)\nGiven \\( g(x) = x + b \\), we need to find \\( b \\) such that the sum \\( g(1) + g(2) + \\cdots + g(20) \\) is minimized. The sum is:\n\\[ \\sum_{i=1}^{20} g(i) = \\sum_{i=1}^{20} (i + b) = \\sum_{i=1}^{20} i + 20b \\]\n\\[ = \\frac{20 \\cdot 21}{2} + 20b = 210 + 20b \\]\n\nTo minimize this sum, we need to minimize \\( b \\). The smallest possible value for \\( b \\) is 0, but we need to check if \\( g(x) = x \\) satisfies the tenuous property.\n\n### Step 8: Verifying the Tenuous Property\nFor \\( g(x) = x \\):\n\\[ g(x) + g(y) = x + y > x^2 \\]\nThis inequality does not hold for all \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).

Suppose that $A_{2}=0$ and $A_{3}=A_{1}$, so that the number begins $\\underline{A_{1}} \\underline{0} \\underline{A_{1}} \\underline{A_{4}}$. If the number is to be fibbish, $A_{4} \\geq A_{1}>0$.

This means that for any three consecutive digits \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) (where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are the first two digits), the condition \\(c \\geq a + b\\) must hold.\n\n2. **Start with the Largest Possible Digits**: To maximize the number, we should start with the largest possible digits for the first two positions. The largest single-digit number is 9. Therefore, let's set the first two digits as 9 and 9.\n\n3. **Generate the Next Digits**: Using the rule \\(c \\geq a + b\\), we can generate the next digits. Let's denote the digits of the number as \\(d_1, d_2, d_3, \\ldots\\). We already have \\(d_1 = 9\\) and \\(d_2 = 9\\). For \\(d_3\\), we need \\(d_3 \\geq 9 + 9 = 18\\).

{"idx": 366, "question": "An ARMLbar is a $7 \\times 7$ grid of unit squares with the center unit square removed. A portion of an ARMLbar is a square section of the bar, cut along the gridlines of the original bar. Compute the number of different ways there are to cut a single portion from an ARMLbar.", "gt_cot": "None", "gt": "96", "unit": null, "solution": ["Note that any portion of side length $m \\geq 4$ will overlap the center square, so consider only portions of side length 3 or less. If there were no hole in the candy bar, the number of portions could be counted by conditioning on the possible location of the upper-left corner of the portion. If the portion is of size $1 \\times 1$, then the corner can occupy any of the $7^{2}$ squares of the bar. If the portion is of size $2 \\times 2$, then the corner can occupy any of the top 6 rows and any of the left 6 columns, for $6^{2}=36$ possible $2 \\times 2$ portions. In general, the upper-left corner of an $m \\times m$ portion can occupy any of the top $8-m$ rows and any of the left $8-m$ columns.

If $f:[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] \\rightarrow[2,3,4,5,1,7,8,6,9,10]$, then $f$ has one cycle of period 5 and one cycle of period 3 , so the period of $f$ is 15 .

So $s_{1}=s_{0}$, and for all $n, s_{n}=s_{n+1}$; in short, the period of $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ is just 1 .\n\nIn order for $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ to have a period greater than $1, f$ must be many-to-one, so that some values occur more than once (and some values do not occur at all) in the sum $f(1)+f(2)+\\cdots+f(10)$ (or, in the original problem, $f(1)+f(2)+\\cdots+f(20)$ ). For example, consider the function $f_{2}$ below:\n\n$$\nf_{2}:[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] \\rightarrow[2,3,4,5,1,10,9,10,7,3]\n$$\n\nNote that $s_{1}=2+3+4+5+1+10+9+10+7+3 \\neq 55$, so $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ is not immediately periodic. But $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ is eventually periodic, as the following argument shows. The function $f_{2}$ has two cycles: $1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow 4 \\rightarrow 5 \\rightarrow 1$, and $7 \\rightarrow 9 \\rightarrow 7$. There are also two paths that meet up with the first cycle: $6 \\rightarrow 10 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow \\cdots$ and $8 \\rightarrow 10 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow \\cdots$. Thus for all $k$ in $T, f_{2}\\left(f_{2}(k)\\right)$ is an element of one of these two extended cycles. Thus $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ eventually becomes periodic.\n\nThe criterion that the function be many-to-one is necessary, but not sufficient, for $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ to have period greater than 1 . To see why, consider the function $g:[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] \\rightarrow$ $[2,3,4,5,6,1,8,7,8,7]$. This function is many-to-one, and contains two cycles, $1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow$ $3 \\rightarrow 4 \\rightarrow 5 \\rightarrow 6 \\rightarrow 1$ and $7 \\rightarrow 8 \\rightarrow 7$. But because $g(9)=8$ and $g(10)=7$, the sum $s_{1}=2+3+4+5+6+1+8+7+8+7$, while $s_{2}=3+4+5+6+1+2+7+8+7+8$. In fact, for $n>1, s_{n+1}=s_{n}$, because applying $f$ only permutes the 6 -cycle and switches the two 7 's and two 8's. That is, in the list $\\underbrace{(g \\circ \\cdots \\circ g)}_{n}(1), \\ldots, \\underbrace{(g \\circ \\cdots \\circ g)}_{n}(10)$, the values 7 and 8 both show up exactly twice. This cycle is balanced: each of its elements shows up the same number of times for all $n$ in the list $\\underbrace{(g \\circ \\cdots \\circ g)}_{n}(1), \\ldots, \\underbrace{(g \\circ \\cdots \\circ g)}_{n}(10)$, for all $n$ after a certain point. The conclusion is that not all many-to-one functions produce unbalanced cycles.\n\nThere are two ways a function $g$ can produce balanced cycles. First, the cycles can be selfcontained, so no element outside of the cycle is ever absorbed into the cycle, as happens with the 6-cycle in the example above. Alternatively, the outside elements that are absorbed into a cycle can all arrive at different points of the cycle, so that each element of the cycle occurs equally often in each iteration of $g$. In the example above, the values $g(9)=7$ and $g(10)=8$ balance the $7 \\rightarrow 8 \\rightarrow 7$ cycle. On the other hand, in the function $f_{2}$ above, $f(f(6))=f(f(8))=f(f(1))=3$, making the large cycle unbalanced: in $s_{2}$, the value 3 appears three times in $s_{2}$, but the value 2 only appears once in $s_{2}$.\n\nThe foregoing shows that only unbalanced cycles can affect the periodicity of $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$. Because each element of a balanced cycle occurs equally often in each iteration, the period of that component of the sum $s_{n}$ attributed to the cycle is simply 1. (The case where $f$ is a permutation of $S$ is simply a special case of this result.) In the above example, the large cycle is\n\n\n\nunbalanced. Note the following results under $f_{2}$.\n\n| $n$ | $\\overbrace{\\left(f_{2} \\circ \\cdots \\circ f_{2}\\right)}^{n}(T)$ | $s_{n}$ |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| 1 | $[2,3,4,5,1,10,9,10,7,3]$ | 54 |\n| 2 | $[3,4,5,1,2,3,7,3,9,4]$ | 41 |\n| 3 | $[4,5,1,2,3,4,9,4,7,5]$ | 40 |\n| 4 | $[5,1,2,3,4,5,7,5,9,1]$ | 42 |\n| 5 | $[1,2,3,4,5,1,9,1,7,2]$ | 35 |\n| 6 | $[2,3,4,5,1,2,7,2,9,3]$ | 38 |\n| 7 | $[3,4,5,1,2,3,9,3,7,4]$ | 41 |\n| 8 | $[4,5,1,2,3,4,7,4,9,5]$ | 40 |\n| 9 | $[5,1,2,3,4,5,9,5,7,1]$ | 42 |\n\nThe period of $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ for $f_{2}$ is 5 , the period of the unbalanced cycle.\n\nThe interested reader may inquire whether all unbalanced cycles affect the periodicity of $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$; we encourage those readers to explore the matter independently. For the purposes of solving this problem, it is sufficient to note that unbalanced cycles can affect $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ 's periodicity.\n\nFinally, note that an unbalanced $k$-cycle actually requires at least $k+1$ elements: $k$ to form the cycle, plus at least 1 to be absorbed into the cycle and cause the imbalance. For the original set $S$, one way to create such an imbalance would be to have $f(20)=f(1)=$ $2, f(2)=3, f(3)=4, \\ldots, f(19)=1$. This arrangement creates an unbalanced cycle of length 19. But breaking up into smaller unbalanced cycles makes it possible to increase the period of $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ even more, because then in most cases the period is the least common multiple of the periods of the unbalanced cycles. For example, $f:[1,2,3, \\ldots, 20]=$ $[2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,1,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,11,11,11]$ has an unbalanced cycle of length 9 and an unbalanced cycle of length 8 , giving $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ a period of 72 .\n\nSo the goal is to maximize $\\operatorname{lcm}\\left\\{k_{1}, k_{2}, \\ldots, k_{m}\\right\\}$ such that $k_{1}+k_{2}+\\cdots+k_{m}+m \\leq 20$. With $m=2$, the maximal period is 72 , achieved with $k_{1}=9$ and $k_{2}=8$. With $m=3$, $k_{1}+k_{2}+k_{3} \\leq 17$, but $\\operatorname{lcm}\\{7,6,4\\}=84<\\operatorname{lcm}\\{7,5,4\\}=140$. This last result can be obtained with unbalanced cycles of length 4,5 , and 7 , with the remaining four points entering the three cycles (or with one point forming a balanced cycle of length 1, i.e., a fixed point). Choosing larger values of $m$ decreases the values of $k$ so far that they no longer form long cycles: when $m=4, k_{1}+k_{2}+k_{3}+k_{4} \\leq 16$, and even if $k_{4}=2, k_{3}=3$, and $k_{2}=5$, for a period of 30 , the largest possible value of $k_{1}=6$, which does not alter the period. (Even $k_{1}=7, k_{2}=5$, and $k_{3}=k_{4}=2$ only yields a period of 70 .) Thus the maximum period of $s_{n}$ is $\\mathbf{1 4 0}$.

Since each triangle has three sides, the number of ways to choose two sides from the five triangles is given by the combination formula \\( \\binom{5}{2} \\), which represents the number of ways to choose 2 items from 5 without regard to order.\n\n\\[\n\\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 10 possible pairs of sides.

Exactly one number in such a sequence will be a multiple of 5 , but that number could also be a multiple of 2 and hence share a common factor with at least one other number in the sequence. There are several cases to consider, namely whether the sequence starts with an even number or an odd number.\n\nIf the sequence starts with an even number, then the second and fourth numbers are both odd, and at least one of them is not a multiple of 3 and hence is relatively prime to all other numbers in the sequence because it is neither a multiple of 2 nor 3 and hence is at least 5 away from the nearest integer with a common factor. Thus the sequence contains a cromulent element.\n\nIf the sequence starts with an odd number, then again, it contains an odd number that is not a multiple of 3 and hence is relatively prime to all other numbers in the sequence, thus the sequence contains a cromulent element.

Let's proceed step by step.\n\n1. **Simplify the Function:**\n   The function is already in a simplified form, so we don't need to perform any further simplifications.\n\n2. **Analyze the Function:**\n   We need to find the critical points of the function by taking its derivative and setting it to zero.

The sum is $1+1+3+7=12$. A list with fewer than four numbers cannot produce a median and unique mode that are distinct from each other. To see this, first note that a list with one number has the same median and mode. In a list with two numbers, the mode is not unique if the numbers are different, and if the numbers are the same, the median and mode are equal. In a list of three numbers with a unique mode, the mode must occur twice. Hence the\n\n\n\nmode is equal to the middle number of the three, which is the median.

This means that the painted face must be on the opposite side of the cube from the faces that are not painted.\n\n3. **Count the number of ways to arrange the small cubes:**\n   We need to count the number of ways to arrange the small cubes such that the painted face is on the opposite side. This is equivalent to choosing one of the $6$ faces of the original cube to be the painted face and then arranging the remaining $7$ small cubes in the remaining $7$ positions.\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of possible arrangements:**\n   The total number of ways to arrange the $8$ small cubes is $8!$ (8 factorial).\n\n5. **Calculate the number of favorable arrangements:**\n   There are $6$ faces on the original cube, and for each face, there is exactly one way to arrange the remaining $7$ small cubes such that the painted face is on the opposite side. Therefore, the number of favorable arrangements is $6 \\times 7!$.\n\n6. **Compute the probability:**\n   The probability is the ratio of the number of favorable arrangements to the total number of possible arrangements:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Probability} = \\frac{6 \\times 7!}{8!} = \\frac{6 \\times 7!}{8 \\times 7!} = \\frac{6}{8} = \\frac{3}{4}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that no paint is showing is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}\\)."], "pred": ["\\frac{3}{4}"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

Because $d$ is an integer, $x^{2}$ is an integer, so either $x$ is an integer or irrational. The following argument shows that $x$ cannot be irrational.

Let $x=7 k$ so that $d=c k$. Rewrite the original proportion using $7 k$ for $x$ and $c k$ for $d$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{c}{d} & =\\frac{x}{d+7} \\\\\n\\frac{c}{c k} & =\\frac{7 k}{c k+7} \\\\\n7 k^{2} & =c k+7 \\\\\n7 k & =c+\\frac{7}{k} .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n\n\nBecause the left side of this last equation represents an integer, $7 / k$ must be an integer, so either $k=1$ or $k=7$.

So, the pair $(b, c) = (0, 0)$ is a valid solution.\n\n5. **Counting the Pairs:**\n   - For Case 1, we need to count the number of integer pairs $(b, c)$ such that $b + c = -1$ with $-20 \\leq b \\leq 20$ and $-20 \\leq c \\leq 20$.\n     - The possible values for $b$ range from $-20$ to $20$.

Observe that $f(x+3)=f(x)+1+9=f(x)+10$. Let $g(x)=f(x)-\\frac{10}{3} x$. Then $g$ is periodic, because $g(x+3)=f(x)+10-\\frac{10 x}{3}-\\frac{10 \\cdot 3}{3}=g(x)$. The graph of $g$ is shown below:\n\n<img_3987>\n\nBecause $g(x)$ is the (vertical) distance between the graph of $y=f(x)$ and the line $y=\\frac{10}{3} x$, the fact that $g$ is periodic implies that $f$ always stays within some fixed distance $D$ of the line $y=\\frac{10}{3} x$. On the other hand, because $\\frac{10}{3}>\\sqrt{11}$, the graph of $y=\\frac{10}{3} x$ gets further and further away from the graph of $y=\\sqrt{11} x$ as $x$ increases. Because the graph of $y=f(x)$ remains near $y=\\frac{10}{3} x$, the graph of $y=f(x)$ drifts upward from the line $y=\\sqrt{11} x$.\n\nFor each integer $n$, define the open interval $I_{n}=\\left(\\frac{n-1}{3}, \\frac{n}{3}\\right)$. In fact, $f$ is constant on $I_{n}$, as the following argument shows. For $x \\in I_{n}, \\frac{n}{9}-\\frac{1}{9}<\\frac{x}{3}<\\frac{n}{9}$. Because $n$ is an integer, there are no integers between $\\frac{n}{9}-\\frac{1}{9}$ and $\\frac{n}{9}$, so $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{x}{3}\\right\\rfloor$ is constant; similarly, $\\lceil 3 x\\rceil$ is constant on the same intervals. Let $l_{n}$ be the value of $f$ on the interval $I_{n}$, and let $L_{n}=f\\left(\\frac{n}{3}\\right)$, the value at the right end of the interval $I_{n}$. If $n$ is not a multiple of 9 , then $l_{n}=L_{n}$, because as $x$ increases from $n-\\varepsilon$ to $n$, the floor function does not increase. This means that $f$ is actually constant on the half-closed interval $\\left(\\frac{n-1}{3}, \\frac{n}{3}\\right]$. If neither $n$ nor $n+1$ are multiples of 9 , then $l_{n+1}=l_{n}+1$. However if $n$ is a multiple of 9 , then $L_{n}=l_{n}+1$ and $l_{n+1}=L_{n}+1$. (The value of $f(x)$ increases when $x$ increases from $n-\\varepsilon$ to $n$, as well as going from $n$ to $n+\\varepsilon$.)\n\nHence on each interval of the form $(3 n-3,3 n)$, the graph of $f$ looks like 9 steps of height 1 and width $\\frac{1}{3}$, all open on the left and closed on the right except for the last step, which is open on both ends. Between the intervals $(3 n-3,3 n)$ and $(3 n, 3 n+3), f(x)$ increases by 2 , with $f(3 n)$ halfway between steps. This graph is shown below:\n\n\n\n<img_3187>\n\nOn each interval $(3 n-3,3 n)$, the average rate of change is $3<\\sqrt{11}$, so the steps move down relative $y=\\sqrt{11} x$ within each interval. At the end of each interval, the graph of $f$ rises relative to $y=\\sqrt{11} x$. Thus the last intersection point between $f(x)$ and $\\sqrt{11} x$ will be on the ninth step of one of these intervals. Suppose this intersection point lies in the interval $(3 k-3,3 k)$. The ninth step is of height $10 k-1$. Set $x=3 k-r$, where $r<\\frac{1}{3}$.

To simplify somewhat, we can take the square root of both sides, and get $z^{3} \\cdot w^{2}=0+b i$, where $b$ is a real number. Then $(1+x i)^{3}(1+3 x i)^{2}=$ $0+b i$. Expanding each binomial and collecting real and imaginary terms in each factor yields $\\left(\\left(1-3 x^{2}\\right)+\\left(3 x-x^{3}\\right) i\\right)\\left(\\left(1-9 x^{2}\\right)+6 x i\\right)=0+b i$. In order that the real part of the product be 0 , we have $\\left(1-3 x^{2}\\right)\\left(1-9 x^{2}\\right)-\\left(3 x-x^{3}\\right)(6 x)=0$. This equation simplifies to $1-30 x^{2}+33 x^{4}=0$, yielding $x^{2}=\\frac{15 \\pm 8 \\sqrt{3}}{33}$. Notice that $\\frac{15 \\pm 8 \\sqrt{3}}{33} \\approx 1$, which would mean that $x \\approx 1$, and $\\operatorname{so} \\tan ^{-1}(x) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{4}$, which is too large, since $6 \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{4}>\\pi$. (It can be verified that this value for $x$ yields a value of $3 \\pi$ for the left side of the equation.) Therefore we are left with $x^{2}=\\frac{15-8 \\sqrt{3}}{\\mathbf{3 3}}$. To verify that this answer is reasonable, consider that $\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.73$, so that $15-8 \\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.16$, and so $x^{2} \\approx \\frac{7}{200}=0.035$. Then $x$ itself is a little less than 0.2 , and so\n\n\n\n$\\tan ^{-1} x \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{15}$. Similarly, $3 x$ is about 0.6 , so $\\tan ^{-1}(3 x)$ is about $\\frac{\\pi}{6} \\cdot 6 \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{15}+4 \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{6}$ is reasonably close to $\\pi$.", "Recall that $\\tan (a+b)=\\frac{\\tan a+\\tan b}{1-\\tan a \\tan b}$, thus $\\tan (2 a)=\\frac{2 \\tan a}{1-\\tan ^{2} a}$ and\n\n$$\n\\tan (3 a)=\\tan (2 a+a)=\\frac{\\frac{2 \\tan a}{1-\\tan ^{2} a}+\\tan a}{1-\\frac{2 \\tan a}{1-\\tan ^{2} a} \\cdot \\tan a}=\\frac{2 \\tan a+\\tan a-\\tan ^{3} a}{1-\\tan ^{2} a-2 \\tan ^{2} a}=\\frac{3 \\tan a-\\tan ^{3} a}{1-3 \\tan ^{2} a}\n$$\n\nBack to the problem at hand, divide both sides by 2 to obtain $3 \\tan ^{-1} x+2 \\tan ^{-1}(3 x)=\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. Taking the tangent of the left side yields $\\frac{\\tan \\left(3 \\tan ^{-1} x\\right)+\\tan \\left(2 \\tan ^{-1}(3 x)\\right)}{1-\\tan \\left(3 \\tan ^{-1} x\\right) \\tan \\left(2 \\tan ^{-1}(3 x)\\right)}$. We know that the denominator must be 0 since $\\tan \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ is undefined, thus $1=\\tan \\left(3 \\tan ^{-1} x\\right) \\tan \\left(2 \\tan ^{-1}(3 x)\\right)=$ $\\frac{3 x-x^{3}}{1-3 x^{2}} \\cdot \\frac{2 \\cdot 3 x}{1-(3 x)^{2}}$ and hence $\\left(1-3 x^{2}\\right)\\left(1-9 x^{2}\\right)=\\left(3 x-x^{3}\\right)(6 x)$. Simplifying yields $33 x^{4}-$ $30 x^{2}+1=0$, and applying the quadratic formula gives $x^{2}=\\frac{15 \\pm 8 \\sqrt{3}}{33}$. The \" + \" solution is extraneous: as noted in the previous solution, $x=\\frac{15+8 \\sqrt{3}}{33}$ yields a value of $3 \\pi$ for the left side of the equation), so we are left with $x^{2}=\\frac{\\mathbf{1 5}-\\mathbf{8} \\sqrt{\\mathbf{3}}}{\\mathbf{3 3}}$."], "answer_type": "Numerical", "subfield": "Algebra", "code": ["To solve the equation \\(6 \\tan^{-1} x + 4 \\tan^{-1}(3x) = \\pi\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Isolate one of the inverse tangents:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\tan^{-1} x + 4 \\tan^{-1}(3x) = \\pi\n   \\]\n   Let \\( \\theta = \\tan^{-1} x \\).

Since the ellipse is tangent to the $x$-axis, the distance from the focus $(3,7)$ to the $x$-axis is $a$, and the distance from the focus $(d,7)$ to the $x$-axis is also $a$. Similarly, since the ellipse is tangent to the $y$-axis, the distance from the focus $(3,7)$ to the $y$-axis is $b$, and the distance from the focus $(d,7)$ to the $y$-axis is also $b$.\n\nNow, we can use the distance formula to find the distances from the foci to the axes. The distance from the focus $(3,7)$ to the $x$-axis is $|7| = 7$, and the distance from the focus $(d,7)$ to the $x$-axis is $|d-3|$. Since these distances are equal to the semi-major axis $a$, we have $|d-3| = 7$. Similarly, the distance from the focus $(3,7)$ to the $y$-axis is $|3| = 3$, and the distance from the focus $(d,7)$ to the $y$-axis is $|d-7|$. Since these distances are equal to the semi-minor axis $b$, we have $|d-7| = 3$.\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n1. $|d-3| = 7$\n2. $|d-7| = 3$\n\nWe can solve these equations to find the value of $d$. Let's consider the first equation. Since the absolute value of a number is always non-negative, we have two cases:\n1. $d-3 = 7$\n2. $d-3 = -7$\n\nSolving these equations, we get:\n1. $d = 10$\n2. $d = -4$\n\nNow, let's consider the second equation. Again, since the absolute value of a number is always non-negative, we have two cases:\n1. $d-7 = 3$\n2. $d-7 = -3$\n\nSolving these equations, we get:\n1. $d = 10$\n2. $d = 4$\n\nWe have two possible values for $d$: $10$ and $4$. However, we need to check which value satisfies both equations. If $d = 10$, then the foci are at $(3,7)$ and $(10,7)$, and the distances from the foci to the axes are $7$ and $3$, which satisfy the equations. If $d = 4$, then the foci are at $(3,7)$ and $(4,7)$, and the distances from the foci to the axes are $3$ and $3$, which do not satisfy the equations.\n\nTherefore, the value of $d$ is $\\boxed{10}$."], "pred": ["10"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

We can solve this system to find the values of these unknowns.\n\nLet's solve the third equation for $b_1$:\n\n$b_1 = \\frac{15 - (1 - b_1) - 2(3 + b_1 - b_1 \\cdot r) - b_1 \\cdot r^2}{1}$\n\nNow, let's substitute this expression for $b_1$ into the fourth equation:\n\n$c_4 = (1 - b_1) + 3(3 + b_1 - b_1 \\cdot r) + b_1 \\cdot r^3 = 2$\n\nWe now have a single equation with one unknown ($r$). We can solve this equation to find the value of $r$.\n\nLet's solve the equation for $r$:\n\n$r^3 - 3r^2 + 2r - 1 = 0$\n\nThis is a cubic equation, and we can solve it using various methods, such as factoring or numerical methods. In this case, we can factor the equation as follows:\n\n$(r - 1)(r^2 - 2r + 1) = 0$\n\nThis gives us two possible values for $r$: $r = 1$ and $r = 1$. Since $r = 1$ would make the geometric sequence constant, we can discard this solution. Therefore, we have $r = 1$.\n\nNow that we have the value of $r$, we can substitute it back into the expressions for $a_1$ and $d$:\n\n$a_1 = 1 - b_1$\n$d = 3 + b_1 - b_1 \\cdot r = 3 + b_1 - b_1 \\cdot 1 = 3$\n\nNow that we have the values of $a_1$ and $d$, we can find the value of $c_5$:\n\n$c_5 = a_5 + b_5 = a_1 + 4d + b_1 \\cdot r^4 = 1 + 4(3) + b_1 \\cdot 1^4 = 1 + 12 + b_1 = 13 + b_1$\n\nTo find the value of $b_1$, we can substitute the value of $r$ into the expression for $b_1$:\n\n$b_1 = \\frac{15 - (1 - b_1) - 2(3 + b_1 - b_1 \\cdot r) - b_1 \\cdot r^2}{1} = \\frac{15 - (1 - b_1) - 2(3 + b_1 - b_1 \\cdot 1) - b_1 \\cdot 1^2}{1} = \\frac{15 - (1 - b_1) - 2(3 + b_1 - b_1) - b_1}{1} = \\frac{15 - (1 - b_1) - 2(3) - b_1}{1} = \\frac{15 - (1 - b_1) - 6 - b_1}{1} = \\frac{15 - 1 + b_1 - 6 - b_1}{1} = \\frac{8}{1} = 8$\n\nNow that we have the value of $b_1$, we can find the value of $c_5$:\n\n$c_5 = 13 + b_1 = 13 + 8 = 21$\n\nTherefore, the value of $c_5$ is $\\boxed{21}$."], "pred": ["21"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

Because there are exactly 10000 integers in that interval, exactly one of them is divisible by 10000 , so there is exactly one value of $t$ satisfying $0 \\leq p(s)+625(m-16 t)<10000$, and set $x_{s}=625(m-16 t)$.\n\nTherefore there will be 16 integers whose base- 2 and base- 5 representations end in the same four digits, possibly with leading 0 's as in the example. Let $X=x_{0000}+\\cdots+x_{1111}$. Then $X$ is congruent modulo 16 to $0000_{2}+\\cdots+1111_{2}=8 \\cdot\\left(1111_{2}\\right)=8 \\cdot 15 \\equiv 8$.

We can form the following pairs:\n- (1,3)\n- (1,7)\n- (1,9)\n- (3,1)\n- (3,7)\n- (3,9)\n- (7,1)\n- (7,3)\n- (7,9)\n- (9,1)\n- (9,3)\n\nThis gives us exactly 11 pairs. Now, we need to arrange these pairs to form the smallest possible integer. We can arrange them as follows:\n-

However, we need to consider only the triangles that are formed by the sides and diagonals of the hexagon.\n\n2. **Count the Triangles:**\n   The triangles in the hexagon can be categorized as follows:\n   - Triangles formed by the sides of the hexagon: There are 6 such triangles.\n   - Triangles formed by the diagonals: There are 10 such triangles (since each diagonal of the hexagon forms a triangle with two sides of the hexagon).\n\n3. **Coloring the Triangles:**\n   We need to ensure that each of these 20 triangles has at least one red side. Let's denote the sides of the hexagon as \\( A_1A_2, A_2A_3, A_3A_4, A_4A_5, A_5A_6, A_6A_1 \\) and the diagonals as \\( A_1A_4, A_1A_5, A_2A_5, A_2A_6, A_3A_6, A_3A_1, A_4A_6, A_4A_1, A_5A_2, A_5A_3 \\).\n\n4. **Counting Valid Colorings:**\n   We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to count the number of valid colorings. However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that each triangle must have at least one red side. This means that if we color the sides of the hexagon, the diagonals will automatically be colored in such a way that each triangle has at least one red side.\n\n5. **Coloring the Sides:**\n   Each side of the hexagon can be colored either red or blue. There are \\( 2^6 = 64 \\) ways to color the 6 sides of the hexagon.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   Since each coloring of the sides automatically ensures that each triangle has at least one red side, the number of valid colorings is simply the number of ways to color the sides of the hexagon, which is 64.\n\nTherefore, the number of colorings such that every triangle \\( A_i A_j A_k \\) has at least one red side is \\(\\boxed{64}\\)."], "pred": ["64"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

Each minute, she must flip exactly $k$ different light switches (to \"flip\" a switch means to turn it on if it is currently off, and off if it is currently on). At the end of each minute, if all of the switches are on, then the door unlocks and Elizabeth escapes from the room.\n\nLet $E(n, k)$ be the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to escape, for positive integers $n, k$ with $k \\leq n$. For example, $E(2,1)=2$ because Elizabeth cannot escape in one minute (there are two switches and one must be flipped every minute) but she can escape in two minutes (by flipping Switch 1 in the first minute and Switch 2 in the second minute).

There are a total of 20 instances of the digit 2 in the thousands place. The digit 0 only occurs in the hundreds place if the thousands digit is 2 , so look at the numbers 1 through 1999. Each non-zero digit contributes an equal number of times, so there are 200 each of $1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9$. The same applies to the tens digit, except there can be the stray digit of 1 among the numbers 2010 through 2019, but again, these do not affect the product.

Define a lucky trio to be a sequence of three consecutive integers, $n, n+1, n+2$, each of which is a semiprime. Note that a lucky trio must contain exactly one multiple of 3. Also note that the middle number in a lucky trio must be even. To see this, note that if the first and last numbers in a lucky trio were both even, then exactly one of these numbers would be a multiple of 4 . But neither $2,3,4$ nor 4,5,6 is a lucky trio, and if a list of three consecutive integers contains a multiple of 4 that is greater than 4 , this number cannot be a semiprime. Using this conclusion and because $3,4,5$ is not a lucky trio, it follows that the middle number of a lucky trio cannot be a multiple of 4 .

Together, these selfies count $3 x+y$ pairs of student appearances. There are $\\left(\\begin{array}{l}8 \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)=28$ pairs of student appearances. Hence $3 x+y=28$.

There are $2 \\cdot 4=8$ (individual) student appearances other than $s_{1}$ on these 4 selfies. Because there are only 7 students besides $s_{1}$, some other student $s_{2}$ had at least $[8 / 7\\rceil$ (individual) appearances on these 4 selfies; that is, $s_{2}$ appeared (with $s_{1}$ ) in at least 2 of these 4 three-person selfies, violating the condition that each pair of the students appears in exactly one selfie. Thus the answer is $\\mathbf{1 2}$."], "answer_type": "Numerical", "subfield": "Combinatorics", "code": ["To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of selfies such that each pair of students appears in exactly one selfie. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Total number of pairs**: First, calculate the total number of unique pairs among the 8 students. This can be done using the combination formula \\( \\binom{n}{2} \\), where \\( n \\) is the number of students. For 8 students, this is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8!}{2!(8-2)!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2 \\times 1} = 28\n   \\]\n   So, there are 28 unique pairs of students.\n\n2. **Selfies with 2 students each**: Each selfie with 2 students will contribute 1 pair to the total count. Let \\( x \\) be the number of selfies with 2 students each. Then, the total number of pairs contributed by these selfies is \\( x \\).\n\n3. **Selfies with 3 students each**: Each selfie with 3 students will contribute 3 pairs to the total count. Let \\( y \\) be the number of selfies with 3 students each. Then, the total number of pairs contributed by these selfies is \\( 3y \\).\n\n4. **Equation for total pairs**: The sum of pairs from both types of selfies must equal the total number of pairs (28):\n   \\[\n   x + 3y = 28\n   \\]\n\n5. **Minimizing selfies**: We want to minimize the total number of selfies \\( x + y \\). To do this, we should maximize the number of selfies with 3 students each because they contribute more pairs per selfie.\n\n6. **Finding the optimal values**: Start by setting \\( y \\) to its maximum possible value while ensuring \\( x \\) remains non-negative. The maximum value for \\( y \\) is when \\( 3y \\) is just less than or equal to 28. Solving for \\( y \\):\n   \\[\n   3y \\leq 28 \\implies y \\leq \\left\\lfloor \\frac{28}{3} \\right\\rfloor = 9\n   \\]\n   So, the maximum integer value for \\( y \\) is 9. Now, calculate \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   x = 28 - 3 \\times 9 = 28 - 27 = 1\n   \\]\n\n7. **Total number of selfies**: The total number of selfies is \\( x + y = 1 + 9 = 10 \\).\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of selfies required so that each pair of the eight students appears in exactly one selfie is \\(\\boxed{10}\\)."], "pred": ["10"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

Thus any morphed sequence has positive integer terms.\n- The sequence $T$ is strictly increasing, and morphs preserve this property. Thus any morphed sequence is strictly increasing.\n\n\n\nNow if the morphed sequence is an arithmetic progression, it follows from the above three observations that it must have the form\n\n$$\n(38.5-4.5 d, 38.5-3.5 d, \\ldots, 38.5+4.5 d)\n$$\n\nwhere $d$ is an odd positive integer satisfying $38.5-4.5 d>0$. Therefore the only possible values of $d$ are $7,5,3,1$; thus there are at most four possibilities for the morphed sequence, shown in the table below. Denote these four sequences by $A, B, C, D$.\n\n|  | $T$ | 1 | 4 | 9 | 16 | 25 | 36 | 49 | 64 | 81 | 100 |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $d=7:$ | $A$ | 7 | 14 | 21 | 28 | 35 | 42 | 49 | 56 | 63 | 70 |\n| $d=5:$ | $B$ | 16 | 21 | 26 | 31 | 36 | 41 | 46 | 51 | 56 | 61 |\n| $d=3:$ | $C$ | 25 | 28 | 31 | 34 | 37 | 40 | 43 | 46 | 49 | 52 |\n| $d=1:$ | $D$ | 34 | 35 | 36 | 37 | 38 | 39 | 40 | 41 | 42 | 43 |\n\nStep 2. Given any two sequences $X=\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{10}\\right)$ and $Y=\\left(y_{1}, \\ldots, y_{10}\\right)$ with $\\sum_{i=1}^{10} x_{i}=\\sum_{i=1}^{10} y_{i}=385$, define the taxicab distance\n\n$$\n\\rho(X, Y)=\\sum_{i=1}^{10}\\left|x_{i}-y_{i}\\right|\n$$\n\nObserve that if $X^{\\prime}$ is a morph of $X$, then $\\rho\\left(X^{\\prime}, Y\\right) \\geq \\rho(X, Y)-2$. Therefore the number of morphs required to transform $T$ into some sequence $Z$ is at least $\\frac{1}{2} \\rho(T, Z)$. Now\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} \\rho(T, A)=\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{10}\\left|i^{2}-7 i\\right|=56\n$$\n\nand also $\\rho(T, A)<\\min (\\rho(T, B), \\rho(T, C), \\rho(T, D))$. Thus at least 56 morphs are needed to obtain sequence $A$ (and more morphs would be required to obtain any of sequences $B, C$, or $D$ ).\n\nStep 3. To conclude, it remains to verify that one can make 56 morphs and arrive from $T$ to $A$. One of many possible constructions is given below.\n\n| $T$ | 1 | 4 | 9 | 16 | 25 | 36 | 49 | 64 | 81 | 100 |\n| ---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| 6 morphs | 1 | 4 | 9 | 16 | 25 | 42 | 49 | 58 | 81 | 100 |\n| 2 morphs | 1 | 4 | 9 | 16 | 27 | 42 | 49 | 56 | 81 | 100 |\n| 8 morphs | 1 | 4 | 9 | 16 | 35 | 42 | 49 | 56 | 73 | 100 |\n| 10 morphs | 1 | 4 | 9 | 26 | 35 | 42 | 49 | 56 | 63 | 100 |\n| 2 morphs | 1 | 4 | 9 | 28 | 35 | 42 | 49 | 56 | 63 | 98 |\n| 12 morphs | 1 | 4 | 21 | 28 | 35 | 42 | 49 | 56 | 63 | 86 |\n| 10 morphs | 1 | 14 | 21 | 28 | 35 | 42 | 49 | 56 | 63 | 76 |\n| 6 morphs | 7 | 14 | 21 | 28 | 35 | 42 | 49 | 56 | 63 | 70 |\n\nTherefore the least number of morphs needed to transform $T$ into an arithmetic progression is $\\mathbf{5 6}$."], "answer_type": "Numerical", "subfield": "Algebra", "code": ["To solve this problem, we need to find the least number of morphs needed to transform the sequence $1^2, 2^2, 3^2, \\ldots, 10^2$ into an arithmetic progression. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Sequence**: The given sequence is $1^2, 2^2, 3^2, \\ldots, 10^2$, which simplifies to $1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100$.\n\n2. **Define Morph Operation**: A morph operation replaces two terms $a$ and $b$ with $a+1$ and $b-1$ if and only if $a+1 < b-1$. This means we can only perform a morph if the next term is smaller than the previous term minus one.\n\n3. **Find the Arithmetic Progression**: We need to find the arithmetic progression that matches the given sequence. An arithmetic progression has a common difference $d$ between consecutive terms. Let's denote the first term of the arithmetic progression as $a$ and the common difference as $d$.\n\n4. **Calculate the Common Difference**: We can calculate the common difference $d$ by finding the difference between consecutive terms in the given sequence. For example, $4 - 1 = 3$, $9 - 4 = 5$, $16 - 9 = 7$, and so on. The differences are $3, 5, 7, \\ldots$. This suggests that the common difference $d$ is $2n - 1$ for the $n$-th term.\n\n5. **Determine the First Term**: The first term $a$ of the arithmetic progression can be found by subtracting the common difference from the second term. For example, $4 - 3 = 1$. So, the first term $a$ is $1$.\n\n6. **Verify the Arithmetic Progression**: We need to verify that the sequence $1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100$ can be transformed into an arithmetic progression with the first term $1$ and common difference $2n - 1$.\n\n7. **Perform Morph Operations**: We need to perform morph operations to transform the sequence into an arithmetic progression. We can start by performing morph operations on the terms that are not in the arithmetic progression. For example, we can perform a morph on $1$ and $4$ to get $2$ and $3$. Then, we can perform a morph on $3$ and $9$ to get $4$ and $8$. We can continue this process until the sequence is in the arithmetic progression.\n\n8. **Count the Morph Operations**: We need to count the number of morph operations performed to transform the sequence into an arithmetic progression.\n\nAfter performing the morph operations, we find that the least number of morphs needed to transform the sequence $1^2, 2^2, 3^2, \\ldots, 10^2$ into an arithmetic progression is $\\boxed{4}$."], "pred": ["4"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

First note that two sides of the polygon intersect at a vertex if and only if the sides are adjacent. So the sides chosen must be nonconsecutive. Second, if nonparallel sides $s_{i}$ and $s_{j}$ are extended, the angle of intersection is determined by $|i-j|$, as are the lengths of the extended portions of the segments. In other words, the spacing of the extended sides completely determines the shape of the triangle. So the problem reduces to selecting appropriate spacings, that is, finding integers $a, b, c \\geq 2$ whose sum is 16 . However, diametrically opposite sides are parallel, so (for example) the sides $s_{3}$ and $s_{11}$ cannot both be used. Thus none of $a, b, c$ may equal 8 .

Since the 16-gon is regular, any triangle formed by extending three sides will be similar to the others. However, we need to account for the fact that some triangles might be congruent due to symmetry.\n\n4. **Symmetry Considerations**: The 16-gon has rotational symmetry of order 16. This means that any triangle formed by extending three sides can be rotated to match another triangle. Therefore, we need to count the distinct triangles up to rotation.\n\n5. **Counting Distinct Triangles**: To count the distinct triangles, we can use combinatorial methods. We need to choose 3 sides out of the 16 sides of the 16-gon to extend. However, we must ensure that the chosen sides do not share a vertex with the 16-gon. This is a complex combinatorial problem, but we can simplify it by considering the symmetry of the 16-gon.\n\n6. **Final Calculation**: After considering the symmetry and the combinatorial aspects, we find that the number of noncongruent triangles that can be formed is given by the number of ways to choose 3 sides out of 16, divided by the number of rotations that make the triangles congruent.

Second, when $\\ell$ passes to the right of or through the rightmost vertex of $\\triangle P Q R$, which occurs when $A-1 \\geq \\max (B, 17)$, the probability is 0 . The remaining cases are as follows.\n\nCase 1: The line $\\ell$ intersects $\\overline{P Q}$ and $\\overline{P R}$ when $1 \\leq A-1 \\leq 17$ and $A-1 \\leq B$.\n\nCase 2: The line $\\ell$ intersects $\\overline{P Q}$ and $\\overline{Q R}$ when $1 \\leq A-1 \\leq 17$ and $A-1 \\geq B$.\n\nCase 3: The line $\\ell$ intersects $\\overline{P R}$ and $\\overline{Q R}$ when $17 \\leq A-1 \\leq B$.\n\nNow proceed case by case.\n\nCase 1: Let $T$ be the point of intersection of $\\ell$ and $\\overline{P R}$. Then the desired probability is $[M Q R T] /[P Q R]=1-[P M T] /[P Q R]$. Since $\\triangle P M T \\sim \\triangle P X R$ and the areas of similar triangles are proportional to the squares of corresponding sides, $[P M T] /[P X R]=(P M / P X)^{2}$. Since $\\triangle P X R$ and $\\triangle P Q R$ both have height $X R$, their areas are proportional to their bases: $[P X R] /[P Q R]=P X / P Q$. Taking the product, $[P M T] /[P Q R]=(P M / P X)^{2}(P X / P Q)=$ $\\frac{P M^{2}}{P X \\cdot P Q}=\\frac{(A-2)^{2}}{(B-1)(17-1)}$, and the final answer is\n\n$$\n\\frac{[M Q R T]}{[P Q R]}=1-\\frac{[P M T]}{[P Q R]}=1-\\frac{(A-2)^{2}}{16(B-1)}\n$$\n\nCase 2: Let $U$ be the point of intersection of $\\ell$ and $\\overline{Q R}$. A similar analysis to the one in the previous case yields\n\n$$\n\\frac{[M Q U]}{[P Q R]}=\\frac{[M Q U]}{[X Q R]} \\cdot \\frac{[X Q R]}{[P Q R]}=\\left(\\frac{M Q}{X Q}\\right)^{2} \\frac{X Q}{P Q}=\\frac{(18-A)^{2}}{16(17-B)}\n$$\n\nCase 3: Let $T$ be the point of intersection of $\\ell$ and $\\overline{P R}$ and let $U$ be the point of intersection of $\\ell$ and $\\overline{Q R}$ as in the previous cases. Let $S$ be the point on $\\overline{P R}$ such that $\\overline{Q S} \\perp \\overline{P Q}$. Then $\\triangle T U R \\sim \\triangle S Q R$, so the areas of these two triangles are proportional to the squares of the corresponding altitudes $M X$ and $Q X$. Thinking of $\\overleftrightarrow{P R}$ as the common base, $\\triangle S Q R$ and $\\triangle P Q R$ have a common altitude, so the ratio of their areas is $S R / P R$. Since $\\triangle P Q S \\sim$ $\\triangle P X R, P S / P R=P Q / P X$ and so $\\frac{S R}{P R}=1-\\frac{P S}{P R}=1-\\frac{P Q}{P X}=\\frac{Q X}{P X}$. Therefore the desired probability is\n\n$$\n\\frac{[T U R]}{[P Q R]}=\\frac{[T U R]}{[S Q R]} \\cdot \\frac{[S Q R]}{[P Q R]}=\\left(\\frac{M X}{Q X}\\right)^{2} \\frac{Q X}{P X}=\\frac{(B-A+1)^{2}}{(B-17)(B-1)}\n$$\n\nUsing the answers from positions 7 and $9, A=4+1+4=9$ and $B=2+7=9$. The first case applies, so the probability is\n\n$$\n1-\\frac{(9-2)^{2}}{16(9-1)}=1-\\frac{49}{128}=\\frac{\\mathbf{7 9}}{\\mathbf{1 2 8}}\n$$"], "answer_type": "Numerical", "subfield": "Algebra", "code": ["To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the number at position 7**: Since the problem doesn't specify what number is at position 7, let's assume it's a number like 123456789. The sum of its digits, $A$, would be $1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9 = 45$.\n\n2. **Determine the number at position 9**: Similarly, if the number at position 9 is 123456789, then $B$ would be the sum of its digits, which is also $45$.\n\n3. **Define the triangle**: The vertices of the triangle are $(1,1)$, $(45, 7)$, and $(17,1)$. We need to find the area of this triangle.\n\n4. **Calculate the area of the triangle**: The formula for the area of a triangle given its vertices $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, and $(x_3, y_3)$ is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \\right|\n   \\]\n   Substituting the given points:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 1(7 - 1) + 45(1 - 1) + 17(1 - 7) \\right| = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 6 + 0 - 102 \\right| = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| -96 \\right| = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 96 = 48\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine the region where $x > A - 1$**: Since $A = 45$, we need to find the region where $x > 44$.

Substitute the given value of $T=11$ into the equation:\n   \\[\n   11 + x = 25\n   \\]\n\n5. Solve for $x$ by subtracting 11 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   x = 25 - 11\n   \\]\n   Simplifying gives:\n   \\[\n   x = 14\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the value of $x$ that satisfies the equation is $\\boxed{14}$."], "pred": ["14"], "report": [null], "score": [true]}
