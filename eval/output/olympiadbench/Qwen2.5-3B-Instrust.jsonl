If $t_{1}, \\ldots, t_{k}$ are pairwise distinct points in the open unit interval $(0,1)$, then some $t_{i}$ is isolated from the other $t_{j}$ by an open subinterval of $(0,1)$ whose length is greater than or equal to $\\lambda$.\n\n\n\nLemma 2.

Suppose, if possible, that no $t_{i}$ is isolated from the other $t_{j}$ by an open subinterval of $(0,1)$ whose length is greater than or equal to $\\lambda$. Without loss of generality, we may (and will) assume that $0=t_{0}<t_{1}<\\cdots<t_{k}<t_{k+1}=1$. Since the open interval $\\left(t_{i-1}, t_{i+1}\\right)$ isolates $t_{i}$ from the other $t_{j}$, its length, $t_{i+1}-t_{i-1}$, is less than $\\lambda$. Consequently, if $k$ is odd we have $1=\\sum_{i=0}^{(k-1) / 2}\\left(t_{2 i+2}-t_{2 i}\\right)<\\lambda\\left(1+\\frac{k-1}{2}\\right)<1$; if $k$ is even, we have $1<1+t_{k}-t_{k-1}=$ $\\sum_{i=0}^{k / 2-1}\\left(t_{2 i+2}-t_{2 i}\\right)+\\left(t_{k+1}-t_{k-1}\\right)<\\lambda\\left(1+\\frac{k}{2}\\right)<1$. A contradiction in either case.\n\n\n\nProof of Lemma 2. Let $I_{0}$, respectively $I_{1}$, be the set of all indices $i$ in the range $2, \\ldots, k-1$ such that $m_{i}$ is even, respectively odd. Clearly, $I_{0}$ and $I_{1}$ form a partition of that range. Since $m_{i} \\geq 2$ if $i$ is in $I_{0}$, and $m_{i} \\geq 1$ if $i$ is in $I_{1}$ (recall that the $m_{i}$ are positive integers),\n\n\n\n$$\n\n\\sum_{i=2}^{k-1} m_{i}=\\sum_{i \\in I_{0}} m_{i}+\\sum_{i \\in I_{1}} m_{i} \\geq 2\\left|I_{0}\\right|+\\left|I_{1}\\right|=2(k-2)-\\left|I_{1}\\right|, \\quad \\text { or } \\quad\\left|I_{1}\\right| \\geq 2(k-2)-\\sum_{i=2}^{k-1} m_{i}\n\n$$\n\n\n\nTherefore,\n\n\n\n$$\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n\n\\left\\lfloor\\frac{m_{1}}{2}\\right\\rfloor+\\sum_{i=1}^{k}\\left\\lfloor\\frac{m_{i}}{2}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor\\frac{m_{k}}{2}\\right\\rfloor & \\leq m_{1}+\\left(\\sum_{i=2}^{k-1} \\frac{m_{i}}{2}-\\frac{\\left|I_{1}\\right|}{2}\\right)+m_{k} \\\\\n\n& \\leq m_{1}+\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=2}^{k-1} m_{i}-(k-2)+\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=2}^{k-1} m_{i}\\right)+m_{k} \\\\\n\n& =\\sum_{i=1}^{k} m_{i}-k+2 .\n\n\\end{aligned}\n\n$$"], "answer_type": "Expression", "subfield": "Algebra", "code": ["To determine the largest real number \\(\\mu\\) such that for every \\(4n\\)-point configuration \\(C\\) in an open unit square \\(U\\), there exists an open rectangle in \\(U\\) whose sides are parallel to those of \\(U\\) and which contains exactly one point of \\(C\\), and has an area greater than or equal to \\(\\mu\\), we will proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find the largest \\(\\mu\\) such that for any \\(4n\\) points in the unit square, there is a rectangle of area at least \\(\\mu\\) that contains exactly one of these points.\n\n2. **Pigeonhole Principle Application**: Consider the unit square \\(U\\) divided into \\(n \\times n\\) smaller squares, each of area \\(\\frac{1}{n^2}\\).

If $\\mathcal{T} \\subseteq \\mathcal{C} \\cup\\{C\\}$, then $C$ is the unique set in $\\mathcal{T}$ containing $x$ which is impossible. Therefore, there exists $P \\in \\mathcal{T} \\backslash(\\mathcal{C} \\cup\\{C\\})$. By maximality of $\\mathcal{C}$, the collection $\\mathcal{C} \\cup\\{P\\}$ does not satisfy the requirements imposed on $\\mathcal{C}$; since $P \\cup C \\neq X$, this may happen only if $C \\cup P=P$, i.e., if $C \\subset P$. But then $\\mathcal{G}=(\\mathcal{T} \\backslash\\{C\\}) \\cup \\mathcal{C}$ is a tight subcollection in $\\mathcal{B}$ : all elements of $C$ are covered by $\\mathcal{G}$ at least twice (by $P$ and an element of $\\mathcal{C}$ ), and all the rest elements are covered by $\\mathcal{G}$ the same number of times as by $\\mathcal{T}$. A contradiction. Thus $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$ is good.\n\n\n\nSuch modifications may be performed finitely many times, since the total number of elements of sets in $\\mathcal{B}$ increases. Thus, at some moment we arrive at a good collection $\\mathcal{B}$ for which the procedure no longer applies.

Arguing indirectly, we assume that there exists a good collection $\\mathcal{B}$ with $|\\mathcal{B}| \\geq 2 n-1$, and choose one such for the minimal possible value of $n$. Clearly, $n>2$.\n\n\n\nFirstly, we perform a different modification of $\\mathcal{B}$. Choose any $x \\in X$, and consider the subcollection $\\mathcal{B}_{x}=\\{B: B \\in \\mathcal{B}, x \\notin B\\}$. By our assumption, $\\mathcal{B}_{x}$ is not tight. As the union of sets in $\\mathcal{B}_{x}$ is distinct from $X$, either this collection is empty, or there exists an element $y \\in X$ contained in a unique member $A_{x}$ of $\\mathcal{B}_{x}$. In the former case, we add the set $B_{x}=X \\backslash\\{x\\}$ to $\\mathcal{B}$, and in the latter we replace $A_{x}$ by $B_{x}$, to form a new collection $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$.

Indeed, if $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$ has a tight subcollection $\\mathcal{T}$, then $B_{x}$ should lie in $\\mathcal{T}$. Then, as the union of the sets in $\\mathcal{T}$ is distinct from $X$, we should have $\\mathcal{T} \\subseteq \\mathcal{B}_{x} \\cup\\left\\{B_{x}\\right\\}$. But in this case an element $y$ is contained in a unique member of $\\mathcal{T}$, namely $B_{x}$, so $\\mathcal{T}$ is not tight - a contradiction.\n\n\n\nPerform this procedure for every $x \\in X$, to get a good collection $\\mathcal{B}$ containing the sets $B_{x}=X \\backslash\\{x\\}$ for all $x \\in X$. Consider now an element $x \\in X$ such that $\\left|\\mathcal{B}_{x}\\right|$ is maximal. As we have mentioned before, there exists an element $y \\in X$ belonging to a unique member (namely, $B_{x}$ ) of $\\mathcal{B}_{x}$. Thus, $\\mathcal{B}_{x} \\backslash\\left\\{B_{x}\\right\\} \\subset \\mathcal{B}_{y}$; also, $B_{y} \\in \\mathcal{B}_{y} \\backslash \\mathcal{B}_{x}$. Thus we get $\\left|\\mathcal{B}_{y}\\right| \\geq\\left|\\mathcal{B}_{x}\\right|$, which by the maximality assumption yields the equality, which in turn means that $\\mathcal{B}_{y}=\\left(\\mathcal{B}_{x} \\backslash\\left\\{B_{x}\\right\\}\\right) \\cup\\left\\{B_{y}\\right\\}$.\n\n\n\nTherefore, each set in $\\mathcal{B} \\backslash\\left\\{B_{x}, B_{y}\\right\\}$ contains either both $x$ and $y$, or none of them.

First, we note a key property:\n\n\n\nClaim (Sign of $f$ ). $f$ attains wither only nonnegative values, or only nonpositive values.\n\n\n\nProof. This follows from the fact that the zero-set of $f$ is very sparse: if $f$ takes on a positive and a negative value, we can move $A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}$ from the negative value to the positive value without ever having them form a regular $2 n$-gon - a contradiction.\n\n\n\nThe strategy for showing $\\operatorname{deg} f \\geq 2 n$ is the following. We will animate the points $A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}$ linearly in a variable $t$; then $g(t)=f\\left(A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}\\right)$ will have degree at most $\\operatorname{deg} f$ (assuming it is not zero). The claim above then establishes that any root of $g$ must be a multiple root, so if we can show that there are at least $n$ roots, we will have shown $\\operatorname{deg} g \\geq 2 n$, and so $\\operatorname{deg} f \\geq 2 n$.\n\n\n\nGeometrically, our goal is to exhibit $2 n$ linearly moving points so that they form a regular $2 n$-gon a total of $n$ times, but not always form one.\n\n\n\nWe will do this as follows. Draw $n$ mirrors through the origin, as lines making angles of $\\frac{\\pi}{n}$ with each other. Then, any point $P$ has a total of $2 n$ reflections in the mirrors, as shown below for $n=5$. (Some of these reflections may overlap.)\n\n\n\nDraw the $n$ angle bisectors of adjacent mirrors. Observe that the reflections of $P$ form a regular $2 n$ gon if and only if $P$ lies on one of the bisectors.\n\n\n\nWe will animate $P$ on any line $\\ell$ which intersects all $n$ bisectors (but does not pass through the origin), and let $P_{1}, \\ldots, P_{2 n}$ be its reflections. Clearly, these are also all linearly animated, and because of the reasons above, they will form a regular $2 n$-gon exactly $n$ times, when $\\ell$ meets each bisector. So this establishes $\\operatorname{deg} f \\geq 2 n$ for the reasons described previously.\n\n\n\nNow we pass to constructing a polynomial $f$ of degree $2 n$ having the desired property. First of all, we will instead find a polynomial $g$ which has this property, but only when points with sum zero are input. This still solves the problem, because then we can choose\n\n\n\n$$\nf\\left(A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}\\right)=g\\left(A_{1}-\\bar{A}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}-\\bar{A}\\right)\n$$\n\n\n\nwhere $\\bar{A}$ is the centroid of $A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}$. This has the upshot that we can now always assume $A_{1}+\\cdots+A_{2 n}=0$, which will simplify the ensuing discussion.\n\n\n\n<img_3624>\n\n\n\nWe will now construct a suitable $g$ as a sum of squares. This means that, if we write $g=g_{1}^{2}+g_{2}^{2}+$ $\\cdots+g_{m}^{2}$, then $g=0$ if and only if $g_{1}=\\cdots=g_{m}=0$, and that if their degrees are $d_{1}, \\ldots, d_{m}$, then $g$ has degree at most $2 \\max \\left(d_{1}, \\ldots, d_{m}\\right)$.\n\n\n\nThus, it is sufficient to exhibit several polynomials, all of degree at most $n$, such that $2 n$ points with zero sum are the vertices of a regular $2 n$-gon if and only if the polynomials are all zero at those points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, we will impose the constraints that all $\\left|A_{i}\\right|^{2}=x_{i}^{2}+y_{i}^{2}$ are equal. This uses multiple degree 2 constraints.\n\n\n\nNow, we may assume that the points $A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}$ all lie on a circle with centre 0 , and $A_{1}+\\cdots+A_{2 n}=0$. If this circle has radius 0 , then all $A_{i}$ coincide, and we may ignore this case.\n\n\n\nOtherwise, the circle has positive radius. We will use the following lemma.\n\n\n\nLemma. Suppose that $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ are complex numbers of the same non-zero magnitude, and suppose that $a_{1}^{k}+\\cdots+a_{2 n}^{k}=0, k=1, \\ldots, n$. Then $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ form a regular $2 n$-gon centred at the origin. (Conversely, this is easily seen to be sufficient.)\n\n\n\nProof. Since all the hypotheses are homogenous, we may assume (mostly for convenience) that $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ lie on the unit circle. By Newton's sums, the $k$-th symmetric sums of $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ are all zero for $k$ in the range $1, \\ldots, n$.\n\n\n\nTaking conjugates yields $a_{1}^{-k}+\\cdots+a_{2 n}^{-k}=0$, $k=1, \\ldots, n$. Thus, we can repeat the above logic to obtain that the $k$-th symmetric sums of $a_{1}^{-1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}^{-1}$ are also all zero for $k=1, \\ldots, n$. However, these are simply the $(2 n-k)$-th symmetric sums of $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ (divided by $a_{1} \\cdots a_{2 n}$ ), so the first $2 n-1$ symmetric sums of $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ are all zero. This implies that $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ form a regular $2 n$-gon centred at the origin.\n\n\n\nWe will encode all of these constraints into our polynomial. More explicitly, write $a_{r}=x_{r}+y_{r} i$; then the constraint $a_{1}^{k}+\\cdots+a_{2 n}^{k}=0$ can be expressed as $p_{k}+q_{k} i=0$, where $p_{k}$ and $q_{k}$ are real polynomials in the coordinates. To incorporate this, simply impose the constraints $p_{k}=0$ and $q_{k}=0$; these are conditions of degree $k \\leq n$, so their squares are all of degree at most $2 n$.\n\n\n\nTo recap, taking the sum of squares of all of these constraints gives a polynomial $f$ of degree at most $2 n$ which works whenever $A_{1}+\\cdots+A_{2 n}=0$.

Such a configuration of chords will be referred to as a Catalan n-configuration. An orientation of the chords in a Catalan configuration $\\mathcal{C}$ making it into a good configuration (in the sense defined in the statement of the problem) will be referred to as a good orientation for $\\mathcal{C}$.\n\nWe show by induction on $n$ that there are exactly $n+1$ good orientations for any Catalan $n$-configuration, so there are exactly $(n+1) C_{n}=\\left(\\begin{array}{c}2 n \\\\ n\\end{array}\\right)$ good configurations on $2 n$ points. The base case $n=1$ is clear.\n\nFor the induction step, let $n>1$, let $\\mathcal{C}$ be a Catalan $n$-configuration, and let $a b$ be a chord of minimal length in $\\mathcal{C}$. By minimality, the endpoints of the other chords in $\\mathcal{C}$ all lie on the major arc $a b$ of the circumference.\n\nLabel the $2 n$ endpoints $1,2, \\ldots, 2 n$ counterclockwise so that $\\{a, b\\}=\\{1,2\\}$, and notice that the good orientations for $\\mathcal{C}$ fall into two disjoint classes: Those containing the arrow $1 \\rightarrow 2$, and those containing the opposite arrow.\n\nSince the arrow $1 \\rightarrow 2$ cannot be involved in a prohibited quadrangle, the induction hypothesis applies to the Catalan $(n-1)$-configuration formed by the other chords to show that the first class contains exactly $n$ good orientations.\n\nFinally, the second class consists of a single orientation, namely, $2 \\rightarrow 1$, every other arrow emerging from the smaller endpoint of the respective chord; a routine verification shows that this is indeed a good orientation. This completes the induction step and ends the proof.\n\n### solution_3\nWe intend to count the number of good orientations of a Catalan $n$-configuration.\n\nFor each such configuration, we consider its dual graph $T$ whose vertices are finite regions bounded by chords and the circle, and an edge connects two regions sharing a boundary segment. This graph $T$ is a plane tree with $n$ edges and $n+1$ vertices.\n\nThere is a canonical bijection between orientations of chords and orientations of edges of $T$ in such a way that each chord crosses an edge of $T$ from the right to the left of the arrow on that edge. A good orientation of chords corresponds to an orientation of the tree containing no two edges oriented towards each other. Such an orientation is defined uniquely by its source vertex, i.e., the unique vertex having no in-arrows.\n\nTherefore, for each tree $T$ on $n+1$ vertices, there are exactly $n+1$ ways to orient it so that the source vertex is unique - one for each choice of the source.

A fictitious domino is good if it is completely covered by a domino in the arrangement; otherwise, it is bad.\n\n\n\nIf the fictitious dominoes are all good, then the dominoes in the arrangement that cover no fictitious domino, if any, all lie in two triangular regions of side-length $m-1$ at the upper-left and upper-right corners of the board.

A finite number of such transformations eventually leads to an arrangement of at least as many dominoes all of whose fictitious dominoes are good, and the conclusion follows by the preceding.\n\n\n\nConsider the row of minimal rank containing bad fictitious dominoes - this is certainly not the bottom row - and let $D$ be one such. Let $\\ell$, respectively $r$, be the left, respectively right, cell of $D$ and notice that the cell below $\\ell$, respectively $r$, is the right, respectively left, cell of a domino $D_{1}$, respectively $D_{2}$, in the arrangement.\n\n\n\nIf $\\ell$ is covered by a domino $D_{\\ell}$ in the arrangement, since $D$ is bad and no two dominoes in the arrangement form a square, it follows that $D_{\\ell}$ is vertical. If $r$ were also covered by a domino $D_{r}$ in the arrangement, then $D_{r}$ would also be vertical, and would therefore form a square with $D_{\\ell}-$ a contradiction. Hence $r$ is not covered, and there is room for $D_{\\ell}$ to be placed so as to cover $D$, to obtain a new arrangement satisfying the conditions in the statement; the latter has as many dominoes as the former, but fewer bad fictitious dominoes. The case where $r$ is covered is dealt with similarly.\n\n\n\nFinally, if neither cell of $D$ is covered, addition of an extra domino to cover $D$ and, if necessary, removal of the domino above $D$ to avoid formation of a square, yields a new arrangement satisfying the conditions in the statement; the latter has at least as many dominoes as the former, but fewer bad fictitious dominoes.

For $0 \\leq i \\leq n-1$, we say that the $i$ th white diagonal is the set of cells of the form $(2 i+k, k)$, where $k$ ranges over all appropriate indices. Similarly, the ith black diagonal is the set of cells of the form $(2 i+1-k, k)$. (Notice that the white cells in the upper-left corner and the black cells in the upper-right corner are not covered by these diagonals.)\n\n\n\nClaim.

Similarly, if $K$ lowest cells of some black diagonal are covered by dominoes, then all these dominoes face left or up from the diagonal.\n\n\n\nProof. By symmetry, it suffices to prove the first statement. Assume that $K$ lowest cells of the $i$ th white diagonal is completely covered. We prove by induction on $k<K$ that the required claim holds for the domino covering $(2 i+k, k)$. The base case $k=0$ holds due to the problem condition. To establish the step, one observes that if $(2 i+k, k)$ is covered by a domino facing up of right, while $(2 i+k+1, k+1)$ is covered by a domino facing down or left, then these two dominoes form a square.\n\n\n\nWe turn to the solution. We will prove that there are at least $d=\\lfloor m / 2\\rfloor$ empty white cells. Since each domino covers exactly one white cell, the required bound follows.\n\n\n\nIf each of the first $d$ white diagonals contains an empty cell, the result is clear. Otherwise, let $i<d$ be the least index of a completely covered white diagonal. We say that the dominoes covering our diagonal are distinguished. After removing the distinguished dominoes, the board splits into two parts; the left part $L$ contains $i$ empty white cells on the previous diagonals. So, it suffices to prove that the right part $R$ contains at least $d-i$ empty white cells.\n\n\n\nLet $j$ be the number of distinguished dominoes facing up. Then at least $j-i$ of these dominoes cover some cells of (distinct) black diagonals (the relation $m \\leq n$ is used). Each such domino faces down from the corresponding black diagonal - so, by the Claim, each such black diagonal contains an empty cell in $R$. Thus, $R$ contains at least $j-i$ empty black cells.\n\n\n\nNow, let $w$ be the number of white cells in $R$. Then the number of black cells in $R$ is $w-d+j$, and at least $i-j$ of those are empty.

Let segments $B_{1} C_{1}$ and $A A_{1}$ intersect at point $X$. Then $X$ also lies in triangle $A C^{\\prime} B^{\\prime}$. Hence $A_{1} X \\geq A X$, and we have\n$$\n\\frac{\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]}{\\left[A C_{1} B_{1}\\right]}=\\frac{\\frac{1}{2} A_{1} X \\cdot B_{1} C_{1} \\cdot \\sin \\angle A_{1} X C_{1}}{\\frac{1}{2} A X \\cdot B_{1} C_{1} \\cdot \\sin \\angle A X B_{1}}=\\frac{A_{1} X}{A X} \\geq 1\n$$\nas required.\n\nOtherwise, each one of triangles $A C^{\\prime} B^{\\prime}, B A^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}, C B^{\\prime} A^{\\prime}$ contains exactly one of points $A_{1}$, $B_{1}, C_{1}$, and we can assume that $B A_{1}<B A^{\\prime}, C B_{1}<C B^{\\prime}, A C_{1}<A C^{\\prime}$ (see Figure 3). Then lines $B_{1} A_{1}$ and $A B$ intersect at a point $Y$ on the extension of $A B$ beyond point $B$, hence $\\frac{\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]}{\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C^{\\prime}\\right]}=\\frac{C_{1} Y}{C^{\\prime} Y}>1$; also, lines $A_{1} C^{\\prime}$ and $C A$ intersect at a point $Z$ on the extension of $C A$ beyond point $A$, hence $\\frac{\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C^{\\prime}\\right]}{\\left[A_{1} B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}\\right]}=\\frac{B_{1} Z}{B^{\\prime} Z}>1$. Finally, since $A_{1} A^{\\prime} \\| B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}$, we have $\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]>\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C^{\\prime}\\right]>\\left[A_{1} B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}\\right]=\\left[A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}\\right]=\\frac{1}{4}[A B C]$.\n\n\n\nNow, from $\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]+\\left[A C_{1} B_{1}\\right]+\\left[B A_{1} C_{1}\\right]+\\left[C B_{1} A_{1}\\right]=[A B C]$ we obtain that one of the remaining triangles $A C_{1} B_{1}, B A_{1} C_{1}, C B_{1} A_{1}$ has an area less than $\\frac{1}{4}[A B C]$, so it is less than $\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]$.\n\nNow we return to the problem. We say that triangle $A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}$ is small if $\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]$ is less than each of $\\left[B B_{1} A_{1}\\right]$ and $\\left[C C_{1} B_{1}\\right]$; otherwise this triangle is big (the similar notion is introduced for triangles $B_{1} C_{1} D_{1}, C_{1} D_{1} A_{1}, D_{1} A_{1} B_{1}$ ). If both triangles $A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}$ and $C_{1} D_{1} A_{1}$ are big, then $\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]$ is not less than the area of some border triangle, and $\\left[C_{1} D_{1} A_{1}\\right]$ is not less than the area of another one; hence, $S_{1}=\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]+\\left[C_{1} D_{1} A_{1}\\right] \\geq S$. The same is valid for the pair of $B_{1} C_{1} D_{1}$ and $D_{1} A_{1} B_{1}$. So it is sufficient to prove that in one of these pairs both triangles are big.\n\nSuppose the contrary. Then there is a small triangle in each pair. Without loss of generality, assume that triangles $A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}$ and $D_{1} A_{1} B_{1}$ are small. We can assume also that $\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right] \\leq$ $\\left[D_{1} A_{1} B_{1}\\right]$. Note that in this case ray $D_{1} C_{1}$ intersects line $B C$.\n\nConsider two cases.\n\n<img_3464>\n\nFigure 4\n\n<img_3580>\n\nFigure 5\n\nCase 1. Ray $C_{1} D_{1}$ intersects line $A B$ at some point $K$. Let ray $D_{1} C_{1}$ intersect line $B C$ at point $L$ (see Figure 4). Then we have $\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]<\\left[C C_{1} B_{1}\\right]<\\left[L C_{1} B_{1}\\right],\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]<\\left[B B_{1} A_{1}\\right]$ (both - since $\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]$ is small), and $\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right] \\leq\\left[D_{1} A_{1} B_{1}\\right]<\\left[A A_{1} D_{1}\\right]<\\left[K A_{1} D_{1}\\right]<\\left[K A_{1} C_{1}\\right]$ (since triangle $D_{1} A_{1} B_{1}$ is small). This contradicts the Lemma, applied for triangle $A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}$ inside $L K B$.\n\nCase 2. Ray $C_{1} D_{1}$ does not intersect $A B$. Then choose a \"sufficiently far\" point $K$ on ray $B A$ such that $\\left[K A_{1} C_{1}\\right]>\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]$, and that ray $K C_{1}$ intersects line $B C$ at some point $L$ (see Figure 5). Since ray $C_{1} D_{1}$ does not intersect line $A B$, the points $A$ and $D_{1}$ are on different sides of $K L$; then $A$ and $D$ are also on different sides, and $C$ is on the same side as $A$ and $B$. Then analogously we have $\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]<\\left[C C_{1} B_{1}\\right]<\\left[L C_{1} B_{1}\\right]$ and $\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]<\\left[B B_{1} A_{1}\\right]$ since triangle $A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}$ is small.

Let's denote the number of ants by $N$.\n\n3. **Key Insight:**\n   - The key insight is that the ants will form a pattern that can be analyzed using the concept of \"closed paths\" or \"cycles\" in the checkerboard.\n   - If we can show that the ants can form a cycle that is large enough, then the last ant will fall off the checkerboard after a certain number of time steps.\n\n4. **Forming a Cycle:**\n   - Suppose we place ants at the midpoints of the squares in a specific pattern that forms a cycle.

This means that the ants will continue to move in a closed path without ever falling off the edges.\n\n5. **Calculating the Time for the Last Ant to Fall Off:**\n   - If the ants form a cycle, the last ant will fall off after a number of time steps equal to the length of the cycle.\n   - The length of the cycle can be at most $2m^2$ (since the ants can move in a closed path that covers all $m^2$ squares twice, forming a cycle of length $2m^2$).\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The latest possible moment at which the last ant falls off the checkerboard is after $2m^2$ time steps.\n   - This is because the ants can form a cycle that is large enough to cover all the squares in the checkerboard and then fall off the edges.\n\nTherefore, the latest possible moment at which the last ant falls off the checkerboard is \\(\\boxed{2m^2}\\)."], "pred": ["2m^2"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

In each cell we write the number of napkins covering it, and we record the maximal number $k$ of cells that all contain the same nonzero number. Considering all possible napkin configurations, what is the largest value of $k$ ?", "gt_cot": "None", "gt": "3986729", "unit": null, "solution": ["Let $m=39$, then $2011=52 m-17$. We begin with an example showing that there can exist 3986729 cells carrying the same positive number.\n\n<img_3188>\n\nTo describe it, we number the columns from the left to the right and the rows from the bottom to the top by $1,2, \\ldots, 2011$. We will denote each napkin by the coordinates of its lowerleft cell. There are four kinds of napkins: first, we take all napkins $(52 i+36,52 j+1)$ with $0 \\leq j \\leq i \\leq m-2$; second, we use all napkins $(52 i+1,52 j+36)$ with $0 \\leq i \\leq j \\leq m-2$; third, we use all napkins $(52 i+36,52 i+36)$ with $0 \\leq i \\leq m-2$; and finally the napkin $(1,1)$. Different groups of napkins are shown by different types of hatchings in the picture.\n\nNow except for those squares that carry two or more different hatchings, all squares have the number 1 written into them. The number of these exceptional cells is easily computed to be $\\left(52^{2}-35^{2}\\right) m-17^{2}=57392$.\n\nWe are left to prove that 3986729 is an upper bound for the number of cells containing the same number. Consider any configuration of napkins and any positive integer $M$. Suppose there are $g$ cells with a number different from $M$. Then it suffices to show $g \\geq 57392$. Throughout the solution, a line will mean either a row or a column.\n\nConsider any line $\\ell$. Let $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{52 m-17}$ be the numbers written into its consecutive cells. For $i=1,2, \\ldots, 52$, let $s_{i}=\\sum_{t \\equiv i(\\bmod 52)} a_{t}$. Note that $s_{1}, \\ldots, s_{35}$ have $m$ terms each, while $s_{36}, \\ldots, s_{52}$ have $m-1$ terms each. Every napkin intersecting $\\ell$ contributes exactly 1 to each $s_{i}$;\n\n\n\nhence the number $s$ of all those napkins satisfies $s_{1}=\\cdots=s_{52}=s$. Call the line $\\ell$ rich if $s>(m-1) M$ and poor otherwise.\n\nSuppose now that $\\ell$ is rich. Then in each of the sums $s_{36}, \\ldots, s_{52}$ there exists a term greater than $M$; consider all these terms and call the corresponding cells the rich bad cells for this line. So, each rich line contains at least 17 cells that are bad for this line.\n\nIf, on the other hand, $\\ell$ is poor, then certainly $s<m M$ so in each of the sums $s_{1}, \\ldots, s_{35}$ there exists a term less than $M$; consider all these terms and call the corresponding cells the poor bad cells for this line. So, each poor line contains at least 35 cells that are bad for this line.\n\nLet us call all indices congruent to $1,2, \\ldots$, or 35 modulo 52 small, and all other indices, i.e. those congruent to $36,37, \\ldots$, or 52 modulo 52 , big. Recall that we have numbered the columns from the left to the right and the rows from the bottom to the top using the numbers $1,2, \\ldots, 52 m-17$; we say that a line is big or small depending on whether its index is big or small. By definition, all rich bad cells for the rows belong to the big columns, while the poor ones belong to the small columns, and vice versa.\n\nIn each line, we put a strawberry on each cell that is bad for this line. In addition, for each small rich line we put an extra strawberry on each of its (rich) bad cells. A cell gets the strawberries from its row and its column independently.\n\nNotice now that a cell with a strawberry on it contains a number different from $M$. If this cell gets a strawberry by the extra rule, then it contains a number greater than $M$. Moreover, it is either in a small row and in a big column, or vice versa. Suppose that it is in a small row, then it is not bad for its column. So it has not more than two strawberries in this case. On the other hand, if the extra rule is not applied to some cell, then it also has not more than two strawberries. So, the total number $N$ of strawberries is at most $2 g$.\n\nWe shall now estimate $N$ in a different way. For each of the $2 \\cdot 35 \\mathrm{~m}$ small lines, we have introduced at least 34 strawberries if it is rich and at least 35 strawberries if it is poor, so at least 34 strawberries in any case. Similarly, for each of the $2 \\cdot 17(m-1)$ big lines, we put at least $\\min (17,35)=17$ strawberries. Summing over all lines we obtain\n\n$$\n2 g \\geq N \\geq 2(35 m \\cdot 34+17(m-1) \\cdot 17)=2(1479 m-289)=2 \\cdot 57392\n$$\n\nas desired.", "We present a different proof of the estimate which is the hard part of the problem. Let $S=35, H=17, m=39$; so the table size is $2011=S m+H(m-1)$, and the napkin size is $52=S+H$. Fix any positive integer $M$ and call a cell vicious if it contains a number distinct\n\n\n\nfrom $M$. We will prove that there are at least $H^{2}(m-1)+2 S H m$ vicious cells.\n\nFirstly, we introduce some terminology. As in the previous solution, we number rows and columns and we use the same notions of small and big indices and lines; so, an index is small if it is congruent to one of the numbers $1,2, \\ldots, S$ modulo $(S+H)$. The numbers $1,2, \\ldots, S+H$ will be known as residues. For two residues $i$ and $j$, we say that a cell is of type $(i, j)$ if the index of its row is congruent to $i$ and the index of its column to $j$ modulo $(S+H)$. The number of vicious cells of this type is denoted by $v_{i j}$.\n\nLet $s, s^{\\prime}$ be two variables ranging over small residues and let $h, h^{\\prime}$ be two variables ranging over big residues. A cell is said to be of class $A, B, C$, or $D$ if its type is of shape $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}\\right),(s, h),(h, s)$, or $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$, respectively. The numbers of vicious cells belonging to these classes are denoted in this order by $a, b, c$, and $d$. Observe that each cell belongs to exactly one class.\n\nClaim 1. We have\n\n$$\nm \\leq \\frac{a}{S^{2}}+\\frac{b+c}{2 S H}\n\\tag{1}\n$$\n\nProof. Consider an arbitrary small row $r$. Denote the numbers of vicious cells on $r$ belonging to the classes $A$ and $B$ by $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, respectively. As in the previous solution, we obtain that $\\alpha \\geq S$ or $\\beta \\geq H$. So in each case we have $\\frac{\\alpha}{S}+\\frac{\\beta}{H} \\geq 1$.\n\nPerforming this argument separately for each small row and adding up all the obtained inequalities, we get $\\frac{a}{S}+\\frac{b}{H} \\geq m S$. Interchanging rows and columns we similarly get $\\frac{a}{S}+\\frac{c}{H} \\geq m S$. Summing these inequalities and dividing by $2 S$ we get what we have claimed.\n\nClaim 2. Fix two small residue $s, s^{\\prime}$ and two big residues $h, h^{\\prime}$. Then $2 m-1 \\leq v_{s s^{\\prime}}+v_{s h^{\\prime}}+v_{h h^{\\prime}}$. Proof. Each napkin covers exactly one cell of type $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}\\right)$. Removing all napkins covering a vicious cell of this type, we get another collection of napkins, which covers each cell of type $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}\\right)$ either 0 or $M$ times depending on whether the cell is vicious or not. Hence $\\left(m^{2}-v_{s s^{\\prime}}\\right) M$ napkins are left and throughout the proof of Claim 2 we will consider only these remaining napkins. Now, using a red pen, write in each cell the number of napkins covering it. Notice that a cell containing a red number greater than $M$ is surely vicious.\n\nWe call two cells neighbors if they can be simultaneously covered by some napkin. So, each cell of type $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ has not more than four neighbors of type $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}\\right)$, while each cell of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ has not more than two neighbors of each of the types $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}\\right)$ and $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$. Therefore, each red number at a cell of type $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ does not exceed $4 M$, while each red number at a cell of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ does not exceed $2 M$.\n\nLet $x, y$, and $z$ be the numbers of cells of type $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ whose red number belongs to $(M, 2 M]$, $(2 M, 3 M]$, and $(3 M, 4 M]$, respectively. All these cells are vicious, hence $x+y+z \\leq v_{h h^{\\prime}}$. The red numbers appearing in cells of type $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ clearly sum up to $\\left(m^{2}-v_{s s^{\\prime}}\\right) M$. Bounding each of these numbers by a multiple of $M$ we get\n\n$$\n\\left(m^{2}-v_{s s^{\\prime}}\\right) M \\leq\\left((m-1)^{2}-(x+y+z)\\right) M+2 x M+3 y M+4 z M\n$$\n\n\n\ni.e.\n\n$$\n2 m-1 \\leq v_{s s^{\\prime}}+x+2 y+3 z \\leq v_{s s^{\\prime}}+v_{h h^{\\prime}}+y+2 z\n$$\n\nSo, to prove the claim it suffices to prove that $y+2 z \\leq v_{s h^{\\prime}}$.\n\nFor a cell $\\delta$ of type $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ and a cell $\\beta$ of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ we say that $\\delta$ forces $\\beta$ if there are more than $M$ napkins covering both of them. Since each red number in a cell of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ does not exceed $2 M$, it cannot be forced by more than one cell.\n\nOn the other hand, if a red number in a $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$-cell belongs to $(2 M, 3 M]$, then it forces at least one of its neighbors of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ (since the sum of red numbers in their cells is greater than $2 M)$. Analogously, an $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$-cell with the red number in $(3 M, 4 M]$ forces both its neighbors of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$, since their red numbers do not exceed $2 M$. Therefore there are at least $y+2 z$ forced cells and clearly all of them are vicious, as desired.\n\nClaim 3. We have\n\n$$\n2 m-1 \\leq \\frac{a}{S^{2}}+\\frac{b+c}{2 S H}+\\frac{d}{H^{2}}\n\\tag{2}\n$$\n\nProof. Averaging the previous result over all $S^{2} H^{2}$ possibilities for the quadruple $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}, h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$, we get $2 m-1 \\leq \\frac{a}{S^{2}}+\\frac{b}{S H}+\\frac{d}{H^{2}}$. Due to the symmetry between rows and columns, the same estimate holds with $b$ replaced by $c$. Averaging these two inequalities we arrive at our claim.\n\nNow let us multiply (2) by $H^{2}$, multiply (II) by $\\left(2 S H-H^{2}\\right)$ and add them; we get\n\n$H^{2}(2 m-1)+\\left(2 S H-H^{2}\\right) m \\leq a \\cdot \\frac{H^{2}+2 S H-H^{2}}{S^{2}}+(b+c) \\frac{H^{2}+2 S H-H^{2}}{2 S H}+d=a \\cdot \\frac{2 H}{S}+b+c+d$.\n\nThe left-hand side is exactly $H^{2}(m-1)+2 S H m$, while the right-hand side does not exceed $a+b+c+d$ since $2 H \\leq S$.

In particular, the total number of L-blocks (or R-blocks, or T-blocks, or B-blocks) is equal to $25 \\cdot 50=1250$.\n\nConsider any B-block of the form $(1, j)$. By $\\left(\\mathrm{i}^{\\prime}\\right)$, all blocks in the $j$ th column are B-blocks; so we call such a column $B$-column. By (ii'), we have 25 B-blocks in the first row, so we obtain 25 B-columns. These $25 \\mathrm{~B}$-columns contain $1250 \\mathrm{~B}$-blocks, hence all blocks in the remaining columns are T-blocks, and we obtain 25 T-columns. Similarly, there are exactly 25 L-rows and exactly 25 -rows.\n\nNow consider an arbitrary pair of a T-column and a neighboring B-column (columns with numbers $j$ and $j+1$ ).\n\n<img_3973>\n\nFig. 1\n\n<img_3920>\n\nFig. 2\n\nCase 1. Suppose that the $j$ th column is a T-column, and the $(j+1)$ th column is a Bcolumn. Consider some index $i$ such that the $i$ th row is an L-row; then $(i, j+1)$ is a BL-block. Therefore, $(i+1, j)$ cannot be a TR-block (see Fig. 2), hence $(i+1, j)$ is a TL-block, thus the $(i+1)$ th row is an L-row. Now, choosing the $i$ th row to be the topmost L-row, we successively obtain that all rows from the $i$ th to the 50th are L-rows. Since we have exactly 25 L-rows, it follows that the rows from the 1st to the 25th are R-rows, and the rows from the 26th to the 50th are L-rows.\n\nNow consider the neighboring R-row and L-row (that are the rows with numbers 25 and 26). Replacing in the previous reasoning rows by columns and vice versa, the columns from the 1 st to the 25th are T-columns, and the columns from the 26th to the 50th are B-columns. So we have a unique arrangement of blocks that leads to the arrangement of kings satisfying the condition of the problem (see Fig. 3).\n\n<img_4043>\n\nFig. 3\n\n<img_3321>\n\nFig. 4\n\nCase 2. Suppose that the $j$ th column is a B-column, and the $(j+1)$ th column is a T-column. Repeating the arguments from Case 1, we obtain that the rows from the 1st to the 25th are L-rows (and all other rows are R-rows), the columns from the 1st to the 25th are B-columns (and all other columns are T-columns), so we find exactly one more arrangement of kings (see Fig. 4)."], "answer_type": "Numerical", "subfield": "Combinatorics", "code": ["To solve the problem, we need to place 2500 chess kings on a \\(100 \\times 100\\) chessboard such that no two kings are in squares that share a common vertex, and each row and each column contains exactly 25 kings. We will reason step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nThe condition that no two kings can capture each other means that no two kings can be placed in squares that share a common vertex. This implies that no two kings can be placed in squares that are adjacent or diagonally adjacent. This is a classic problem in combinatorial design, specifically a type of Latin square or a more specific type of arrangement known as a \"non-attacking\" or \"non-capturing\" arrangement.\n\n### Step 2: Symmetry and Rotational Invariance\nThe problem states that two arrangements differing by rotation or symmetry are considered different. This means we need to find a unique arrangement up to these symmetries.\n\n### Step 3: Constructing the Arrangement\nOne known solution to this problem is the \"Ferrers board\" or \"hook\" arrangement. For a \\(100 \\times 100\\) board, a valid arrangement can be constructed by placing kings in a specific pattern that avoids the capturing condition. One such pattern is to place kings in a \"hook\" shape, which is a well-known solution to this type of problem.\n\n### Step 4: Counting the Arrangements\nThe number of such arrangements is known to be \\(2^{99}\\). This is because the problem of placing kings in a \\(100 \\times 100\\) board such that no two kings are in squares that share a common vertex is equivalent to finding the number of ways to place 25 kings in each row and each column, which is a well-studied problem in combinatorial design.\n\n### Step 5: Final Answer\nThe number of such arrangements is \\(\\boxed{2^{99}}\\)."], "pred": ["2^{99}"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

Then the number of iso-odd triangles with vertices on $\\mathcal{L}$ does not exceed $n / 2$.\n\nProof. This is obvious for $n=2$. Take $n$ with $2<n \\leq 1003$ and assume the claim to be true for every $\\mathcal{L}$ of length less than $n$. Let now $\\mathcal{L}$ (endpoints $A, B$ ) consist of $n$ segments. Let $P Q$ be the longest diagonal which is a side of an iso-odd triangle $P Q S$ with all vertices on $\\mathcal{L}$ (if there is no such triangle, there is nothing to prove). Every triangle whose vertices lie on $\\mathcal{L}$ is obtuse or right-angled; thus $S$ is the summit of $P Q S$. We may assume that the five points $A, P, S, Q, B$ lie on $\\mathcal{L}$ in this order and partition $\\mathcal{L}$ into four pieces $\\mathcal{L}_{A P}, \\mathcal{L}_{P S}, \\mathcal{L}_{S Q}, \\mathcal{L}_{Q B}$ (the outer ones possibly reducing to a point).\n\nBy the definition of $P Q$, an iso-odd triangle cannot have vertices on both $\\mathcal{L}_{A P}$ and $\\mathcal{L}_{Q B}$. Therefore every iso-odd triangle within $\\mathcal{L}$ has all its vertices on just one of the four pieces. Applying to each of these pieces the induction hypothesis and adding the four inequalities we get that the number of iso-odd triangles within $\\mathcal{L}$ other than $P Q S$ does not exceed $n / 2$. And since each of $\\mathcal{L}_{P S}, \\mathcal{L}_{S Q}$ consists of an odd number of sides, the inequalities for these two pieces are actually strict, leaving a $1 / 2+1 / 2$ in excess. Hence the triangle $P S Q$ is also covered by the estimate $n / 2$. This concludes the induction step and proves the lemma.\n\nThe remaining part of the solution in fact repeats the argument from the above proof. Consider the longest dissecting diagonal $X Y$. Let $\\mathcal{L}_{X Y}$ be the shorter of the two parts of the boundary with endpoints $X, Y$ and let $X Y Z$ be the triangle in the dissection with vertex $Z$ not on $\\mathcal{L}_{X Y}$. Notice that $X Y Z$ is acute or right-angled, otherwise one of the segments $X Z, Y Z$ would be longer than $X Y$. Denoting by $\\mathcal{L}_{X Z}, \\mathcal{L}_{Y Z}$ the two pieces defined by $Z$ and applying the lemma to each of $\\mathcal{L}_{X Y}, \\mathcal{L}_{X Z}, \\mathcal{L}_{Y Z}$ we infer that there are no more than 2006/2 iso-odd triangles in all, unless $X Y Z$ is one of them. But in that case $X Z$ and $Y Z$ are odd diagonals and the corresponding inequalities are strict. This shows that also in this case the total number of iso-odd triangles in the dissection, including $X Y Z$, is not greater than 1003.\n\nThis bound can be achieved. For this to happen, it just suffices to select a vertex of the 2006-gon and draw a broken line joining every second vertex, starting from the selected one. Since 2006 is even, the line closes.

We say that these sides belong to the iso-odd triangle $A B C$.\n\nAt least one side in each of these groups does not belong to any other iso-odd triangle. This is so because any odd triangle whose vertices are among the points between $A$ and $B$ has two sides of equal length and therefore has an even number of sides belonging to it in total. Eliminating all sides belonging to any other iso-odd triangle in this area must therefore leave one side that belongs to no other iso-odd triangle. Let us assign these two sides (one in each group) to the triangle $A B C$.\n\nTo each iso-odd triangle we have thus assigned a pair of sides, with no two triangles sharing an assigned side.

A regular 2006-gon can be dissected into 2003 triangles by drawing 2003 nonintersecting diagonals. Each triangle will have two odd sides or two even sides, depending on the configuration of the diagonals.\n\nAn isosceles triangle with two odd sides must have its base as an even side. This is because if the base were an odd side, the other two sides would have to be odd, but the sum of two odd sides and one even side would not be able to form a triangle. Therefore, the base of the isosceles triangle must be an even side.\n\nNow, let's count the number of even sides in the 2006-gon. A regular 2006-gon has 2006 sides, and half of them are even and half are odd. Therefore, there are 1003 even sides and 1003 odd sides.\n\nTo form an isosceles triangle with two odd sides, we need to choose the base as one of the even sides. For each even side, we can form an isosceles triangle with two odd sides. The number of ways to choose the base (an even side) is 1003. For each choice of the base, we need to choose two other vertices such that the two sides connecting these vertices are odd. This is equivalent to choosing 2 vertices out of the remaining 2004 vertices (excluding the endpoints of the base), but we need to ensure that the two chosen vertices form odd sides with the endpoints of the base.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 2 vertices out of 2004 is \\(\\binom{2004}{2} = \\frac{2004 \\times 2003}{2} = 2003 \\times 1002\\). However, not all of these choices will form odd sides. We need to count the valid choices. For each even side, the number of valid choices is 1002 (since we can choose any of the 1002 remaining vertices to form an odd side with the endpoints of the base).\n\nTherefore, the total number of isosceles triangles with two odd sides is \\(1003 \\times 1002 = 1005006\\).\n\nThus, the maximum possible number of isosceles triangles with two odd sides is \\(\\boxed{1005006}\\)."], "pred": ["1005006"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

We need to arrange these numbers in \\( N \\) rows such that the difference between any two numbers in the same column for different rows is at least 2.\n\n3. **Binary Representation Insight:**\n   - One effective way to ensure the difference condition is to use binary representation. Each number from 1 to 100 can be represented in binary with at most 7 bits (since \\( 2^6 = 64 \\) and \\( 2^7 = 128 \\)).\n\n4. **Binary Representation and Columns:**\n   - We can use 7 columns to represent the binary digits of the numbers 1 through 100. Each number will have a unique binary representation in these 7 columns.\n\n5. **Ensuring the Difference Condition:**\n   - If we place the numbers 1 through 100 in the table such that each number is represented in a unique combination of these 7 columns, we can ensure that the difference condition is met. Specifically, if two numbers differ in more than one column, their difference will be at least 2.\n\n6. **Counting the Rows:**\n   - Since we have 100 numbers and 7 columns, we can place up to 100 numbers in the table using these columns. Each number will occupy a unique combination of these columns.\n\n7. **Verification:**\n   - To verify, consider any two rows. If they differ in more than one column, their difference will be at least 2. This is because each column represents a binary digit, and if two numbers differ in more than one column, their binary representations will differ in more than one bit, ensuring the difference is at least 2.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe largest \\( N \\) for which such a table exists is 100. This is because we can place all 100 numbers in the table using the 7 columns, ensuring the difference condition is met.\n\nThus, the largest \\( N \\) is \\(\\boxed{100}\\)."], "pred": ["100"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

Consider all the rays emerging at $O$ and passing through a point from $\\mathcal{K}_{n}$; number them as $r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{m}$ in increasing order according to slope.

We will concentrate on the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve $d_{0} d_{1} \\ldots d_{m}$; let $\\mathcal{D}$ be the set of all lattice points $p$ such that $p \\geqslant p^{\\prime}$ for some (not necessarily lattice) point $p^{\\prime}$ on the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve. In fact, we will show that $\\mathcal{D}=\\mathcal{F}$.\n\nClearly, the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve is symmetric in the line $y=x$. Denote by $D$ the convex hull of $\\mathcal{D}$.\n\n3. We prove that the set $\\mathcal{D}$ contains all stable sets. Let $\\mathcal{S} \\subset \\mathcal{Q}$ be a stable set (recall that it is assumed to be up-right closed and to have a finite complement in $\\mathcal{Q}$ ). Denote by $S$ its convex hull; clearly, the vertices of $S$ are lattice points. The boundary of $S$ consists of two rays (horizontal and vertical ones) along with some $\\mathcal{V}_{*}$-curve for some set of lattice vectors $\\mathcal{V}_{*}$.\n\nClaim 1. For every $\\vec{v}_{i} \\in \\mathcal{V}$, there is a $\\vec{v}_{i}^{*} \\in \\mathcal{V}_{*}$ co-directed with $\\vec{v}$ with $\\left|\\vec{v}_{i}^{*}\\right| \\geqslant|\\vec{v}|$.\n\nProof. Let $\\ell$ be the supporting line of $S$ parallel to $\\vec{v}_{i}$ (i.e., $\\ell$ contains some point of $S$, and the set $S$ lies on one side of $\\ell$ ). Take any point $b \\in \\ell \\cap \\mathcal{S}$ and consider $N(b)$. The line $\\ell$ splits the set $N(b) \\backslash \\ell$ into two congruent parts, one having an empty intersection with $\\mathcal{S}$. Hence, in order for $b$ not to be lonely, at least half of the set $\\ell \\cap N(b)$ (which contains $2 k_{i}$ points) should lie in $S$. Thus, the boundary of $S$ contains a segment $\\ell \\cap S$ with at least $k_{i}+1$ lattice points (including $b$ ) on it; this segment corresponds to the required vector $\\vec{v}_{i}^{*} \\in \\mathcal{V}_{*}$.\n\n<img_3156>\n\nProof of Claim 1\n\n<img_3490>\n\nProof of Claim 2\n\nClaim 2. Each stable set $\\mathcal{S} \\subseteq \\mathcal{Q}$ lies in $\\mathcal{D}$.\n\nProof. To show this, it suffices to prove that the $\\mathcal{V}_{*}$-curve lies in $D$, i.e., that all its vertices do so. Let $p^{\\prime}$ be an arbitrary vertex of the $\\mathcal{V}_{*}$-curve; $p^{\\prime}$ partitions this curve into two parts, $\\mathcal{X}$ (being down-right of $p$ ) and $\\mathcal{Y}$ (being up-left of $p$ ). The set $\\mathcal{V}$ is split now into two parts: $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{X}}$ consisting of those $\\vec{v}_{i} \\in \\mathcal{V}$ for which $\\vec{v}_{i}^{*}$ corresponds to a segment in $\\mathcal{X}$, and a similar part $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{Y}}$. Notice that the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve consists of several segments corresponding to $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{X}}$, followed by those corresponding to $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{Y}}$. Hence there is a vertex $p$ of the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve separating $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{X}}$ from $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{Y}}$. Claim 1 now yields that $p^{\\prime} \\geqslant p$, so $p^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{D}$, as required.\n\nClaim 2 implies that the final set $\\mathcal{F}$ is contained in $\\mathcal{D}$.\n\n4. $\\mathcal{D}$ is stable, and its comfortable points are known. Recall the definitions of $r_{i}$; let $r_{i}^{\\prime}$ be the ray complementary to $r_{i}$. By our definitions, the set $N(O)$ contains no points between the rays $r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$, as well as between $r_{i}^{\\prime}$ and $r_{i+1}^{\\prime}$.\n\nClaim 3. In the set $\\mathcal{D}$, all lattice points of the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve are comfortable.\n\nProof. Let $p$ be any lattice point of the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve, belonging to some segment $d_{i} d_{i+1}$. Draw the line $\\ell$ containing this segment. Then $\\ell \\cap \\mathcal{D}$ contains exactly $k_{i}+1$ lattice points, all of which lie in $N(p)$ except for $p$. Thus, exactly half of the points in $N(p) \\cap \\ell$ lie in $\\mathcal{D}$. It remains to show that all points of $N(p)$ above $\\ell$ lie in $\\mathcal{D}$ (recall that all the points below $\\ell$ lack this property).\n\n\n\nNotice that each vector in $\\mathcal{V}$ has one coordinate greater than $n / 2$; thus the neighborhood of $p$ contains parts of at most two segments of the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve succeeding $d_{i} d_{i+1}$, as well as at most two of those preceding it.\n\nThe angles formed by these consecutive segments are obtained from those formed by $r_{j}$ and $r_{j-1}^{\\prime}$ (with $i-1 \\leqslant j \\leqslant i+2$ ) by shifts; see the Figure below. All the points in $N(p)$ above $\\ell$ which could lie outside $\\mathcal{D}$ lie in shifted angles between $r_{j}, r_{j+1}$ or $r_{j}^{\\prime}, r_{j-1}^{\\prime}$. But those angles, restricted to $N(p)$, have no lattice points due to the above remark. The claim is proved.\n<img_3487>\n\nProof of Claim 3\n\nClaim 4. All the points of $\\mathcal{D}$ which are not on the boundary of $D$ are crowded.\n\nProof. Let $p \\in \\mathcal{D}$ be such a point. If it is to the up-right of some point $p^{\\prime}$ on the curve, then the claim is easy: the shift of $N\\left(p^{\\prime}\\right) \\cap \\mathcal{D}$ by $\\overrightarrow{p^{\\prime} p}$ is still in $\\mathcal{D}$, and $N(p)$ contains at least one more point of $\\mathcal{D}$ - either below or to the left of $p$. So, we may assume that $p$ lies in a right triangle constructed on some hypothenuse $d_{i} d_{i+1}$. Notice here that $d_{i}, d_{i+1} \\in N(p)$.\n\nDraw a line $\\ell \\| d_{i} d_{i+1}$ through $p$, and draw a vertical line $h$ through $d_{i}$; see Figure below. Let $\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{L}}$ and $\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{R}}$ be the parts of $\\mathcal{D}$ lying to the left and to the right of $h$, respectively (points of $\\mathcal{D} \\cap h$ lie in both parts).\n\n<img_3424>\n\nNotice that the vectors $\\overrightarrow{d_{i} p}, \\overrightarrow{d_{i+1} d_{i+2}}, \\overrightarrow{d_{i} d_{i+1}}, \\overrightarrow{d_{i-1} d_{i}}$, and $\\overrightarrow{p d_{i+1}}$ are arranged in non-increasing order by slope. This means that $\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{L}}$ shifted by $\\overrightarrow{d_{i} p}$ still lies in $\\mathcal{D}$, as well as $\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{R}}$ shifted by $\\overrightarrow{d_{i+1} p}$. As we have seen in the proof of Claim 3, these two shifts cover all points of $N(p)$ above $\\ell$, along with those on $\\ell$ to the left of $p$. Since $N(p)$ contains also $d_{i}$ and $d_{i+1}$, the point $p$ is crowded.\n\nThus, we have proved that $\\mathcal{D}=\\mathcal{F}$, and have shown that the lattice points on the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve are exactly the comfortable points of $\\mathcal{D}$. It remains to find their number.\n\nRecall the definition of $\\mathcal{K}_{n}$ (see Figure on the first page of the solution). Each segment $d_{i} d_{i+1}$ contains $k_{i}$ lattice points different from $d_{i}$. Taken over all $i$, these points exhaust all the lattice points in the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve, except for $d_{1}$, and thus the number of lattice points on the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve is $1+\\sum_{i=1}^{m} k_{i}$. On the other hand, $\\sum_{i=1}^{m} k_{i}$ is just the number of points in $\\mathcal{K}_{n}$, so it equals $n^{2}$.

Then the only tangent segments that can be drawn are between adjacent circles $C_{i}$ and $C_{i+1}$, and exactly three segments can be drawn for each pair. So Luciano will draw exactly $3(n-1)$ segments in this case.\n\n<img_3497>\n\nFor the general case, start from a final configuration (that is, an arrangement of circles and segments in which no further segments can be drawn). The idea of the solution is to continuously resize and move the circles around the plane, one by one (in particular, making sure we never have 4 circles with a common tangent line), and show that the number of segments drawn remains constant as the picture changes. This way, we can reduce any circle/segment configuration to the particular one mentioned above, and the final number of segments must remain at $3 n-3$.\n\nSome preliminary considerations: look at all possible tangent segments joining any two circles. A segment that is tangent to a circle $A$ can do so in two possible orientations - it may come out of $A$ in clockwise or counterclockwise orientation. Two segments touching the same circle with the same orientation will never intersect each other. Each pair $(A, B)$ of circles has 4 choices of tangent segments, which can be identified by their orientations - for example, $(A+, B-)$ would be the segment which comes out of $A$ in clockwise orientation and comes out of $B$ in counterclockwise orientation. In total, we have $2 n(n-1)$ possible segments, disregarding intersections.\n\nNow we pick a circle $C$ and start to continuously move and resize it, maintaining all existing tangent segments according to their identifications, including those involving $C$. We can keep our choice of tangent segments until the configuration reaches a transition. We lose nothing if we assume that $C$ is kept at least $\\varepsilon$ units away from any other circle, where $\\varepsilon$ is a positive, fixed constant; therefore at a transition either: (1) a currently drawn tangent segment $t$ suddenly becomes obstructed; or (2) a currently absent tangent segment $t$ suddenly becomes unobstructed and available.\n\nClaim. A transition can only occur when three circles $C_{1}, C_{2}, C_{3}$ are tangent to a common line $\\ell$ containing $t$, in a way such that the three tangent segments lying on $\\ell$ (joining the three circles pairwise) are not obstructed by any other circles or tangent segments (other than $C_{1}, C_{2}, C_{3}$ ). Proof. Since (2) is effectively the reverse of (1), it suffices to prove the claim for (1). Suppose $t$ has suddenly become obstructed, and let us consider two cases.\n\n\n\nCase 1: $t$ becomes obstructed by a circle\n\n<img_3256>\n\nThen the new circle becomes the third circle tangent to $\\ell$, and no other circles or tangent segments are obstructing $t$.\n\nCase 2: $t$ becomes obstructed by another tangent segment $t^{\\prime}$ \n\nWhen two segments $t$ and $t^{\\prime}$ first intersect each other, they must do so at a vertex of one of them. But if a vertex of $t^{\\prime}$ first crossed an interior point of $t$, the circle associated to this vertex was already blocking $t$ (absurd), or is about to (we already took care of this in case 1). So we only have to analyze the possibility of $t$ and $t^{\\prime}$ suddenly having a common vertex. However, if that happens, this vertex must belong to a single circle (remember we are keeping different circles at least $\\varepsilon$ units apart from each other throughout the moving/resizing process), and therefore they must have different orientations with respect to that circle.\n<img_4010>\n\nThus, at the transition moment, both $t$ and $t^{\\prime}$ are tangent to the same circle at a common point, that is, they must be on the same line $\\ell$ and hence we again have three circles simultaneously tangent to $\\ell$. Also no other circles or tangent segments are obstructing $t$ or $t^{\\prime}$ (otherwise, they would have disappeared before this transition).\n\nNext, we focus on the maximality of a configuration immediately before and after a transition, where three circles share a common tangent line $\\ell$. Let the three circles be $C_{1}, C_{2}, C_{3}$, ordered by their tangent points. The only possibly affected segments are the ones lying on $\\ell$, namely $t_{12}, t_{23}$ and $t_{13}$. Since $C_{2}$ is in the middle, $t_{12}$ and $t_{23}$ must have different orientations with respect to $C_{2}$. For $C_{1}, t_{12}$ and $t_{13}$ must have the same orientation, while for $C_{3}, t_{13}$ and $t_{23}$ must have the same orientation. The figure below summarizes the situation, showing alternative positions for $C_{1}$ (namely, $C_{1}$ and $C_{1}^{\\prime}$ ) and for $C_{3}\\left(C_{3}\\right.$ and $C_{3}^{\\prime}$ ).\n\n<img_3756>\n\n\n\nNow perturb the diagram slightly so the three circles no longer have a common tangent, while preserving the definition of $t_{12}, t_{23}$ and $t_{13}$ according to their identifications. First note that no other circles or tangent segments can obstruct any of these segments. Also recall that tangent segments joining the same circle at the same orientation will never obstruct each other.\n\nThe availability of the tangent segments can now be checked using simple diagrams.\n\nCase 1: $t_{13}$ passes through $C_{2}$\n\n<img_3220>\n\nIn this case, $t_{13}$ is not available, but both $t_{12}$ and $t_{23}$ are.\n\nCase 2: $t_{13}$ does not pass through $C_{2}$\n\n<img_3461>\n\nNow $t_{13}$ is available, but $t_{12}$ and $t_{23}$ obstruct each other, so only one can be drawn.\n\nIn any case, exactly 2 out of these 3 segments can be drawn. Thus the maximal number of segments remains constant as we move or resize the circles, and we are done.", "First note that all tangent segments lying on the boundary of the convex hull of the circles are always drawn since they do not intersect anything else. Now in the final picture, aside from the $n$ circles, the blackboard is divided into regions. We can consider the picture as a plane (multi-)graph $G$ in which the circles are the vertices and the tangent segments are the edges. The idea of this solution is to find a relation between the number of edges and the number of regions in $G$; then, once we prove that $G$ is connected, we can use Euler's formula to finish the problem.\n\nThe boundary of each region consists of 1 or more (for now) simple closed curves, each made of arcs and tangent segments. The segment and the arc might meet smoothly (as in $S_{i}$, $i=1,2, \\ldots, 6$ in the figure below) or not (as in $P_{1}, P_{2}, P_{3}, P_{4}$; call such points sharp corners of the boundary). In other words, if a person walks along the border, her direction would suddenly turn an angle of $\\pi$ at a sharp corner.\n\n\n\n<img_3559>\n\nClaim 1. The outer boundary $B_{1}$ of any internal region has at least 3 sharp corners.\n\nProof. Let a person walk one lap along $B_{1}$ in the counterclockwise orientation. As she does so, she will turn clockwise as she moves along the circle arcs, and not turn at all when moving along the lines. On the other hand, her total rotation after one lap is $2 \\pi$ in the counterclockwise direction! Where could she be turning counterclockwise? She can only do so at sharp corners, and, even then, she turns only an angle of $\\pi$ there. But two sharp corners are not enough, since at least one arc must be present - so she must have gone through at least 3 sharp corners.\n\nClaim 2. Each internal region is simply connected, that is, has only one boundary curve.\n\nProof. Suppose, by contradiction, that some region has an outer boundary $B_{1}$ and inner boundaries $B_{2}, B_{3}, \\ldots, B_{m}(m \\geqslant 2)$. Let $P_{1}$ be one of the sharp corners of $B_{1}$.\n\nNow consider a car starting at $P_{1}$ and traveling counterclockwise along $B_{1}$. It starts in reverse, i.e., it is initially facing the corner $P_{1}$. Due to the tangent conditions, the car may travel in a way so that its orientation only changes when it is moving along an arc. In particular, this means the car will sometimes travel forward. For example, if the car approaches a sharp corner when driving in reverse, it would continue travel forward after the corner, instead of making an immediate half-turn. This way, the orientation of the car only changes in a clockwise direction since the car always travels clockwise around each arc.\n\nNow imagine there is a laser pointer at the front of the car, pointing directly ahead. Initially, the laser endpoint hits $P_{1}$, but, as soon as the car hits an arc, the endpoint moves clockwise around $B_{1}$. In fact, the laser endpoint must move continuously along $B_{1}$ ! Indeed, if the endpoint ever jumped (within $B_{1}$, or from $B_{1}$ to one of the inner boundaries), at the moment of the jump the interrupted laser would be a drawable tangent segment that Luciano missed (see figure below for an example).\n\n<img_3484>\n\n\n\nNow, let $P_{2}$ and $P_{3}$ be the next two sharp corners the car goes through, after $P_{1}$ (the previous lemma assures their existence). At $P_{2}$ the car starts moving forward, and at $P_{3}$ it will start to move in reverse again. So, at $P_{3}$, the laser endpoint is at $P_{3}$ itself. So while the car moved counterclockwise between $P_{1}$ and $P_{3}$, the laser endpoint moved clockwise between $P_{1}$ and $P_{3}$. That means the laser beam itself scanned the whole region within $B_{1}$, and it should have crossed some of the inner boundaries.\n\nClaim 3. Each region has exactly 3 sharp corners.\n\nProof. Consider again the car of the previous claim, with its laser still firmly attached to its front, traveling the same way as before and going through the same consecutive sharp corners $P_{1}, P_{2}$ and $P_{3}$. As we have seen, as the car goes counterclockwise from $P_{1}$ to $P_{3}$, the laser endpoint goes clockwise from $P_{1}$ to $P_{3}$, so together they cover the whole boundary. If there were a fourth sharp corner $P_{4}$, at some moment the laser endpoint would pass through it. But, since $P_{4}$ is a sharp corner, this means the car must be on the extension of a tangent segment going through $P_{4}$. Since the car is not on that segment itself (the car never goes through $P_{4}$ ), we would have 3 circles with a common tangent line, which is not allowed.\n\n<img_3207>\n\nWe are now ready to finish the solution. Let $r$ be the number of internal regions, and $s$ be the number of tangent segments. Since each tangent segment contributes exactly 2 sharp corners to the diagram, and each region has exactly 3 sharp corners, we must have $2 s=3 r$. Since the graph corresponding to the diagram is connected, we can use Euler's formula $n-s+r=1$ and find $s=3 n-3$ and $r=2 n-2$."], "answer_type": "Numerical", "subfield": "Geometry", "code": ["To solve the problem, we need to determine the maximum number of tangent segments that can be drawn between 2017 mutually external circles, such that no two tangent segments intersect and no tangent segment intersects any other circles or previously drawn tangent segments.\n\nFirst, let's understand the structure of the problem.

We claim that the required partition exists and is unique. The two diagonals of the board divide the board into four regions. Note that the domino covering cell $(1,1)$ must be vertical.

Assume that only $k<2 n$ cells are marked, and there exists a partition $P$ satisfying the requirement. It suffices to show there exists another desirable partition distinct from $P$. Let $d$ be the main diagonal of the board.\n\nConstruct the following graph with edges of two colours. Its vertices are the cells of the board. Connect two vertices with a red edge if they belong to the same domino of $P$. Connect two vertices with a blue edge if their reflections in $d$ are connected by a red edge. It is possible that two vertices are connected by edges of both colours. Clearly, each vertex has both red and blue degrees equal to 1 . Thus the graph splits into cycles where the colours of edges in each cycle alternate (a cycle may have length 2).\n\nConsider any cell $c$ lying on the diagonal $d$. Its two edges are symmetrical with respect to $d$. Thus they connect $c$ to different cells. This shows $c$ belongs to a cycle $C(c)$ of length at least 4. Consider a part of this cycle $c_{0}, c_{1}, \\ldots, c_{m}$ where $c_{0}=c$ and $m$ is the least positive integer such that $c_{m}$ lies on $d$. Clearly, $c_{m}$ is distinct from $c$. From the construction, the path symmetrical to this with respect to $d$ also lies in the graph, and so these paths together form $C(c)$. Hence, $C(c)$ contains exactly two cells from $d$.

We prove that, in fact, if a board initially contains an even number $n>1$ of ones, then $A$ can guarantee to obtain $S_{2}(n)$, but not more, cookies. The binary representation of 2020 is $2020=\\overline{11111100100}_{2}$, so $S_{2}(2020)=7$, and the answer follows.\n\nA strategy for A. At any round, while possible, A chooses two equal nonzero numbers on the board. Clearly, while $A$ can make such choice, the game does not terminate. On the other hand, $A$ can follow this strategy unless the game has already terminated. Indeed, if $A$ always chooses two equal numbers, then each number appearing on the board is either 0 or a power of 2 with non-negative integer exponent, this can be easily proved using induction on the number of rounds. At the moment when $A$ is unable to follow the strategy all nonzero numbers on the board are distinct powers of 2 . If the board contains at least one such power, then the largest of those powers is greater than the sum of the others. Otherwise there are only zeros on the blackboard, in both cases the game terminates.\n\nFor every number on the board, define its range to be the number of ones it is obtained from. We can prove by induction on the number of rounds that for any nonzero number $k$ written by $B$ its range is $k$, and for any zero written by $B$ its range is a power of 2 . Thus at the end of each round all the ranges are powers of two, and their sum is $n$. Since $S_{2}(a+b) \\leqslant S_{2}(a)+S_{2}(b)$ for any positive integers $a$ and $b$, the number $n$ cannot be represented as a sum of less than $S_{2}(n)$ powers of 2 . Thus at the end of each round the board contains at least $S_{2}(n)$ numbers, while $A$ follows the above strategy. So $A$ can guarantee at least $S_{2}(n)$ cookies for himself.\n\nA strategy for $B$. Denote $s=S_{2}(n)$.\n\nLet $x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{k}$ be the numbers on the board at some moment of the game after $B$ 's turn or at the beginning of the game.

An appropriate strategy for $B$ can be explained as follows: Perform a move so that the situation remains good, while it is possible. We intend to show that in this case $B$ will not lose more than $S_{2}(n)$ cookies. For this purpose, we prove several lemmas.\n\nFor a positive integer $k$, denote by $\\nu_{2}(k)$ the exponent of the largest power of 2 that divides $k$. Recall that, by Legendre's formula, $\\nu_{2}(n !)=n-S_{2}(n)$ for every positive integer $n$.\n\n\n\nLemma 1. The initial situation is good.\n\nProof. In the initial configuration, the number of balanced collections is equal to $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n \\\\ n / 2\\end{array}\\right)$. We have\n\n$$\n\\nu_{2}\\left(\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\nn \\\\\nn / 2\n\\end{array}\\right)\\right)=\\nu_{2}(n !)-2 \\nu_{2}((n / 2) !)=\\left(n-S_{2}(n)\\right)-2\\left(\\frac{n}{2}-S_{2}(n / 2)\\right)=S_{2}(n)=s\n$$\n\nHence $2^{s+1}$ does not divide the number of balanced collections, as desired.\n\nLemma 2. B may play so that after each round the situation remains good.\n\nProof. Assume that the situation $\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{k}\\right)$ before a round is good, and that $A$ erases two numbers, $x_{p}$ and $x_{q}$.\n\nLet $N$ be the number of all balanced collections, $N_{+}$be the number of those having $\\varepsilon_{p}=\\varepsilon_{q}$, and $N_{-}$be the number of other balanced collections. Then $N=N_{+}+N_{-}$. Now, if $B$ replaces $x_{p}$ and $x_{q}$ by $x_{p}+x_{q}$, then the number of balanced collections will become $N_{+}$. If $B$ replaces $x_{p}$ and $x_{q}$ by $\\left|x_{p}-x_{q}\\right|$, then this number will become $N_{-}$. Since $2^{s+1}$ does not divide $N$, it does not divide one of the summands $N_{+}$and $N_{-}$, hence $B$ can reach a good situation after the round.\n\nLemma 3. Assume that the game terminates at a good situation. Then the board contains at most $s$ numbers.\n\nProof. Suppose, one of the numbers is greater than the sum of the other numbers. Then the number of balanced collections is 0 and hence divisible by $2^{s+1}$. Therefore, the situation is not good.\n\nThen we have only zeros on the blackboard at the moment when the game terminates. If there are $k$ of them, then the number of balanced collections is $2^{k}$. Since the situation is good, we have $k \\leqslant s$.\n\nBy Lemmas 1 and 2, $B$ may act in such way that they keep the situation good.

After those $a$ moves, the $a$ coins flipped in those moves are all heads, as is the coin the machine is now at, so at least the next $a+1$ moves will all be moves to the previous coin.

This certainly determines a unique configuration of coins that could possibly correspond to the given sequence. Furthermore, every coin flipped as part of the $a_{j}$ consecutive moves is also flipped as part of all subsequent sequences of $a_{k}$ consecutive moves, for all $k>j$, meaning that, as we follow the moves backwards, each coin is always in the correct state when flipped to result in a move in the required direction. (Alternatively, since there are $2^{n}$ possible configurations of coins and $2^{n}$ possible such ascending sequences, the fact that the sequence of moves determines at most one configuration of coins, and thus that there is an injection from configurations of coins to such ascending sequences, is sufficient for it to be a bijection, without needing to show that coins are in the right state as we move backwards.)", "We explicitly describe what happens with an arbitrary sequence $C$ of $n$ coins.

If there are \\(k\\) heads, the probability that the \\(k\\)-th coin is the one flipped is \\(\\frac{1}{k}\\). Therefore, the expected number of steps to reduce the number of heads by 1 is the sum of the probabilities of each coin being flipped, weighted by the number of steps it takes to reduce the number of heads by 1.\n\nThe expected number of steps to reduce the number of heads by 1 is:\n\\[\nE[\\text{steps to reduce heads by 1}] = \\sum_{k=1}^H \\frac{1}{k} \\cdot 1 = H\n\\]\nThis is because each step reduces the number of heads by 1 on average.\n\nSince the process is repeated \\(H\\) times (one for each head), the total expected number of steps is:\n\\[\nE[\\ell(C)] = H\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Summing Over All Configurations\nThe number of heads \\(H\\) can range from 0 to \\(n\\).

When placing the $n^{\\text {th }}$ wall, it intersects each of the $n-1$ other walls exactly once and hence splits each of $n$ of the regions formed by those other walls into two regions. By the induction hypothesis, this yields $\\left(\\left(\\begin{array}{l}n \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)+1\\right)+n=\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+1 \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)+1$ regions, proving the claim.\n\nNow let $G$ be the graph with vertices given by the $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+1 \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)+1$ regions, and with two regions connected by an edge if there is a door between them.\n\nWe now show that no matter how Merlin paints the $n$ walls, Morgana can place at least $n+1$ knights. No matter how the walls are painted, there are exactly $\\left(\\begin{array}{l}n \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)$ intersection points, each of which corresponds to a single edge in $G$. Consider adding the edges of $G$ sequentially and note that each edge reduces the number of connected components by at most one.

If Morgana places a knight in regions corresponding to different connected components of $G$, then no two knights can ever meet.\n\nNow we give a construction showing that, no matter what shape the labyrinth is, Merlin can colour it such that there are exactly $n+1$ connected components, allowing Morgana to place at most $n+1$ knights.\n\nFirst, we choose a coordinate system on the labyrinth so that none of the walls run due north-south, or due east-west. We then have Merlin paint the west face of each wall red, and the east face of each wall blue. We label the regions according to how many walls the region is on the east side of: the labels are integers between 0 and $n$.\n\nWe claim that, for each $i$, the regions labelled $i$ are connected by doors. First, we note that for each $i$ with $0 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n$ there is a unique region labelled $i$ which is unbounded to the north.\n\nNow, consider a knight placed in some region with label $i$, and ask them to walk north (moving east or west by following the walls on the northern sides of regions, as needed). This knight will never get stuck: each region is convex, and so, if it is bounded to the north, it has a single northernmost vertex with a door northwards to another region with label $i$.\n\nEventually it will reach a region which is unbounded to the north, which will be the unique such region with label $i$. Hence every region with label $i$ is connected to this particular region, and so all regions with label $i$ are connected to each other.\n\nAs a result, there are exactly $n+1$ connected components, and Morgana can place at most $n+1$ knights.", "We give another description of a strategy for Merlin to paint the walls so that Morgana can place no more than $n+1$ knights.\n\nMerlin starts by building a labyrinth of $n$ walls of his own design. He places walls in turn with increasing positive gradients, placing each so far to the right that all intersection points of previously-placed lines lie to the left of it. He paints each in such a way that blue is on the left and red is on the right.\n\nFor example, here is a possible sequence of four such lines $\\ell_{1}, \\ell_{2}, \\ell_{3}, \\ell_{4}$ :\n\n<img_3427>\n\nWe say that a region is \"on the right\" if it has $x$-coordinate unbounded above (note that if we only have one wall, then both regions are on the right). We claim inductively that, after placing $n$ lines, there are $n+1$ connected components in the resulting labyrinth, each of which contains exactly one region on the right. This is certainly true after placing 0 lines, as then there is only one region (and hence one connected component) and it is on the right.\n\nWhen placing the $n^{\\text {th }}$ line, it then cuts every one of the $n-1$ previously placed lines, and since it is to the right of all intersection points, the regions it cuts are exactly the $n$ regions on the right.\n\n<img_3985>\n\nThe addition of this line leaves all previous connected components with exactly one region on the right, and creates a new connected component containing exactly one region, and that region is also on the right. As a result, by induction, this particular labyrinth will have $n+1$ connected components.\n\nHaving built this labyrinth, Merlin then moves the walls one-by-one (by a sequence of continuous translations and rotations of lines) into the proper position of the given labyrinth, in such a way that no two lines ever become parallel.\n\n\n\nThe only time the configuration is changed is when one wall is moved through an intersection point of two others:\n<img_3360>\n\nNote that all moves really do switch between two configurations like this: all sets of three lines have this colour configuration initially, and the rules on rotations mean they are preserved (in particular, we cannot create three lines creating a triangle with three red edges inwards, or three blue edges inwards).\n\nHowever, as can be seen, such a move preserves the number of connected components, so in the painting this provides for Arthur's actual labyrinth, Morgana can still only place at most $n+1$ knights."], "answer_type": "Expression", "subfield": "Combinatorics", "code": ["To determine the value of \\( k(\\mathfrak{L}) \\) for a labyrinth \\(\\mathfrak{L}\\) with \\( n \\) walls, we need to analyze the structure and connectivity of the labyrinth.

If there exist a positive integer $k$ such that there are at least $2 k$ boxes that have at most $k$ pebbles each then Bob can force a win.\n\nProof. We ignore the other boxes.

Thus, at any time during the game, the number of pebbles in each box depends only on which choices Bob has made an odd number of times.

Let $K=\\left\\lfloor\\frac{N}{2}+1\\right\\rfloor$. For Bob's strategy, we consider a configuration $X$ with at most $M-1$ pebbles, and we make use of Observation A. Consider two configurations with $M$ pebbles: $V_{K}$ and $V_{N+1-K}$ (if $n$ is odd, they are the same configuration; if $n$ is even, one is the reverse of the other). The configuration $X$ has fewer pebbles than $V_{K}$ in at least one box, and fewer pebbles than $V_{N+1-K}$ in at least one box.\n\nSuppose first that, with respect to one of those configurations (without loss of generality $V_{K}$ ), $X$ has fewer pebbles in one of the boxes in the half where they have $1,2, \\ldots,\\left\\lceil\\frac{N}{2}\\right\\rceil$ pebbles (the right half in $V_{K}$ if $N$ is even; if $N$ is odd, we can take it to be the right half, without loss of generality, as the configuration is symmetric). Note that the number cannot be fewer in the box with 1 pebble in $V_{K}$, because then it would have 0 pebbles. Bob then does a $K$-move. If Alice picks the right group, the total number of pebbles goes down and we restart Bob's strategy with a smaller number of pebbles. If Alice picks the left group, Bob follows with a $(K+1)$-move, a $(K+2)$-move, and so on; by Observation A we may assume Alice always picks the left group. But whichever box in the right half had fewer pebbles in $X$ than in $V_{K}$ ends up with 0 pebbles at some point in this sequence of moves.\n\nOtherwise, $N$ is even, and for both of those configurations, there are fewer pebbles in $X$ only on the $2,3, \\ldots, \\frac{N}{2}+1$ side.

Alice can always ensure that the number of pebbles in each box remains non-zero by redistributing the pebbles in a way that balances the groups.\n\n3. **Key Insight:**\n   The critical point is to ensure that no box ever ends up with zero pebbles. If \\( n \\geq 60 \\), Alice can always distribute the pebbles in such a way that the number of pebbles in each box is at least 1. This is because if \\( n \\geq 60 \\), Alice can distribute the pebbles such that each box gets at least 1 pebble, and the remaining pebbles can be distributed to ensure no box ends up with zero pebbles.\n\n### Verification\n\nLet's verify that \\( n = 60 \\) is the smallest value that works. If \\( n = 59 \\), Alice can distribute the pebbles such that 59 boxes get 1 pebble each and one box gets 0 pebbles. In this case, Bob can split the boxes into two groups and Alice will remove a pebble from one group and add a pebble to the other group, resulting in a box with 0 pebbles. Therefore, \\( n = 59 \\) is not sufficient.\n\nIf \\( n = 60 \\), Alice can distribute the pebbles such that each box gets exactly 1 pebble. In this case, no box will ever have zero pebbles, and Bob cannot force a box to have zero pebbles. Therefore, \\( n = 60 \\) is sufficient.\n\nThus, the smallest \\( n \\) such that Alice can prevent Bob from winning is \\(\\boxed{60}\\)."], "pred": ["60"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

If we would have $a=1$, then both $b-c$ and $c-b$ were powers of 2 , which is impossible since their sum is zero; because of symmetry, this argument shows $a, b, c \\geqslant 2$.\n\nCase 1. Among $a, b$, and $c$ there are at least two equal numbers.\n\nWithout loss of generality we may suppose that $a=b$. Then $a^{2}-c$ and $a(c-1)$ are powers of 2. The latter tells us that actually $a$ and $c-1$ are powers of 2 . So there are nonnegative integers $\\alpha$ and $\\gamma$ with $a=2^{\\alpha}$ and $c=2^{\\gamma}+1$. Since $a^{2}-c=2^{2 \\alpha}-2^{\\gamma}-1$ is a power of 2 and thus incongruent to -1 modulo 4 , we must have $\\gamma \\leqslant 1$. Moreover, each of the terms $2^{2 \\alpha}-2$ and $2^{2 \\alpha}-3$ can only be a power of 2 if $\\alpha=1$. It follows that the triple $(a, b, c)$ is either $(2,2,2)$ or $(2,2,3)$.\n\nCase 2.

Assume for the sake of contradiction that $\\gamma>0$. Then $c$ is even by (4) and, similarly, $b$ is even by (5) and (3). So the left-hand side of (2) is congruent to 2 modulo 4 , which is only possible if $b c=4$. As this contradicts (1), we have thereby shown that $\\gamma=0$, i.e., that $c=2 b-1$.\n\nNow (3) yields $3 b-2=2^{\\beta}$. Due to $b>2$ this is only possible if $\\beta \\geqslant 4$. If $\\beta=4$, then we get $b=6$ and $c=2 \\cdot 6-1=11$, which is a solution. It remains to deal with the case $\\beta \\geqslant 5$. Now (2) implies\n\n$$\n9 \\cdot 2^{\\alpha}=9 b(2 b-1)-18=(3 b-2)(6 b+1)-16=2^{\\beta}\\left(2^{\\beta+1}+5\\right)-16,\n$$\n\nand by $\\beta \\geqslant 5$ the right-hand side is not divisible by 32 .

On the other hand, $2^{\\beta}=a c-b>$ $(a-1) c \\geqslant 2 c$ implies in view of (1) that $a$ and $b$ are smaller than $2^{\\beta-1}$. All this is only possible if $\\vartheta=1$ and $a+b=2^{\\beta-1}$. Now (3) yields\n\n$$\na c-b=2(a+b),\n\\tag{6}\n$$\n\nwhence $4 b>a+3 b=a(c-1) \\geqslant a b$, which in turn yields $a=3$.\n\nSo (6) simplifies to $c=b+2$ and (2) tells us that $b(b+2)-3=(b-1)(b+3)$ is a power of 2. Consequently, the factors $b-1$ and $b+3$ are powers of 2 themselves. Since their difference is 4 , this is only possible if $b=5$ and thus $c=7$. Thereby the solution is complete.", "As in the beginning of the first solution, we observe that $a, b, c \\geqslant 2$. Depending on the parities of $a, b$, and $c$ we distinguish three cases.\n\nCase 1. The numbers $a, b$, and $c$ are even.\n\nLet $2^{A}, 2^{B}$, and $2^{C}$ be the largest powers of 2 dividing $a, b$, and $c$ respectively. We may assume without loss of generality that $1 \\leqslant A \\leqslant B \\leqslant C$. Now $2^{B}$ is the highest power of 2 dividing $a c-b$, whence $a c-b=2^{B} \\leqslant b$. Similarly, we deduce $b c-a=2^{A} \\leqslant a$. Adding both estimates we get $(a+b) c \\leqslant 2(a+b)$, whence $c \\leqslant 2$. So $c=2$ and thus $A=B=C=1$; moreover, we must have had equality throughout, i.e., $a=2^{A}=2$ and $b=2^{B}=2$. We have thereby found the solution $(a, b, c)=(2,2,2)$.\n\nCase 2. The numbers $a, b$, and $c$ are odd.\n\nIf any two of these numbers are equal, say $a=b$, then $a c-b=a(c-1)$ has a nontrivial odd divisor and cannot be a power of 2 . Hence $a, b$, and $c$ are distinct. So we may assume without loss of generality that $a<b<c$.\n\nLet $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ denote the nonnegative integers for which $b c-a=2^{\\alpha}$ and $a c-b=2^{\\beta}$ hold. Clearly, we have $\\alpha>\\beta$, and thus $2^{\\beta}$ divides\n\n$$\na \\cdot 2^{\\alpha}-b \\cdot 2^{\\beta}=a(b c-a)-b(a c-b)=b^{2}-a^{2}=(b+a)(b-a) .\n$$\n\nSince $a$ is odd, it is not possible that both factors $b+a$ and $b-a$ are divisible by 4 . Consequently, one of them has to be a multiple of $2^{\\beta-1}$. Hence one of the numbers $2(b+a)$ and $2(b-a)$ is divisible by $2^{\\beta}$ and in either case we have\n\n$$\na c-b=2^{\\beta} \\leqslant 2(a+b) .\n\\tag{7}\n$$\n\nThis in turn yields $(a-1) b<a c-b<4 b$ and thus $a=3$ (recall that $a$ is odd and larger than 1). Substituting this back into (7) we learn $c \\leqslant b+2$. But due to the parity $b<c$ entails that $b+2 \\leqslant c$ holds as well. So we get $c=b+2$ and from $b c-a=(b-1)(b+3)$ being a power of 2 it follows that $b=5$ and $c=7$.\n\nCase 3. Among $a, b$, and $c$ both parities occur.\n\nWithout loss of generality, we suppose that $c$ is odd and that $a \\leqslant b$. We are to show that $(a, b, c)$ is either $(2,2,3)$ or $(2,6,11)$. As at least one of $a$ and $b$ is even, the expression $a b-c$ is odd; since it is also a power of 2 , we obtain\n\n$$\na b-c=1 \\text {. }\n\\tag{8}\n$$\n\nIf $a=b$, then $c=a^{2}-1$, and from $a c-b=a\\left(a^{2}-2\\right)$ being a power of 2 it follows that both $a$ and $a^{2}-2$ are powers of 2 , whence $a=2$. This gives rise to the solution $(2,2,3)$.\n\n\n\nWe may suppose $a<b$ from now on. As usual, we let $\\alpha>\\beta$ denote the integers satisfying\n\n$$\n2^{\\alpha}=b c-a \\quad \\text { and } \\quad 2^{\\beta}=a c-b\n\\tag{9}\n$$\n\nIf $\\beta=0$ it would follow that $a c-b=a b-c=1$ and hence that $b=c=1$, which is absurd. So $\\beta$ and $\\alpha$ are positive and consequently $a$ and $b$ are even. Substituting $c=a b-1$ into (9) we obtain\n\n$$\n2^{\\alpha}  =a b^{2}-(a+b), \\tag{10}\n$$\n$$\n\\text { and } \\quad 2^{\\beta}  =a^{2} b-(a+b) .\n\\tag{11}\n$$\n\nThe addition of both equation yields $2^{\\alpha}+2^{\\beta}=(a b-2)(a+b)$. Now $a b-2$ is even but not divisible by 4 , so the highest power of 2 dividing $a+b$ is $2^{\\beta-1}$. For this reason, the equations (10) and (11) show that the highest powers of 2 dividing either of the numbers $a b^{2}$ and $a^{2} b$ is likewise $2^{\\beta-1}$. Thus there is an integer $\\tau \\geqslant 1$ together with odd integers $A, B$, and $C$ such that $a=2^{\\tau} A, b=2^{\\tau} B, a+b=2^{3 \\tau} C$, and $\\beta=1+3 \\tau$.\n\nNotice that $A+B=2^{2 \\tau} C \\geqslant 4 C$. Moreover, (11) entails $A^{2} B-C=2$. Thus $8=$ $4 A^{2} B-4 C \\geqslant 4 A^{2} B-A-B \\geqslant A^{2}(3 B-1)$. Since $A$ and $B$ are odd with $A<B$, this is only possible if $A=1$ and $B=3$. Finally, one may conclude $C=1, \\tau=1, a=2, b=6$, and $c=11$. We have thereby found the triple $(2,6,11)$. This completes the discussion of the third case, and hence the solution.

It remains to show the converse.\n\nAssume that $f$ is a function satisfying the problem condition. Notice that the function $g(x)=f(x)-f(0)$ also satisfies this condition. Replacing $f$ by $g$, we assume from now on that $f(0)=0$; then $f(n)>0$ for any positive integer $n$. Thus, we aim to prove that there exists a positive integer $a$ with $\\mho(a)=0$ such that $f(n)=a n$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nWe start by introducing some notation. Set $N=10^{100}$. We say that a prime $p$ is large if $p>N$, and $p$ is small otherwise; let $\\mathcal{S}$ be the set of all small primes. Next, we say that a positive integer is large or small if all its prime factors are such (thus, the number 1 is the unique number which is both large and small). For a positive integer $k$, we denote the greatest large divisor of $k$ and the greatest small divisor of $k$ by $L(k)$ and $S(k)$, respectively; thus, $k=L(k) S(k)$.\n\nWe split the proof into three steps.\n\nStep 1. We prove that for every large $k$, we have $k|f(a)-f(b) \\Longleftrightarrow k| a-b$. In other $\\overline{\\text { words, }} L(f(a)-f(b))=L(a-b)$ for all integers $a$ and $b$ with $a>b$.\n\nWe use induction on $k$. The base case $k=1$ is trivial. For the induction step, assume that $k_{0}$ is a large number, and that the statement holds for all large numbers $k$ with $k<k_{0}$.\n\nClaim 1. For any integers $x$ and $y$ with $0<x-y<k_{0}$, the number $k_{0}$ does not divide $f(x)-f(y)$.\n\nProof. Assume, to the contrary, that $k_{0} \\mid f(x)-f(y)$. Let $\\ell=L(x-y)$; then $\\ell \\leqslant x-y<k_{0}$. By the induction hypothesis, $\\ell \\mid f(x)-f(y)$, and thus $\\operatorname{lcm}\\left(k_{0}, \\ell\\right) \\mid f(x)-f(y)$. Notice that $\\operatorname{lcm}\\left(k_{0}, \\ell\\right)$ is large, and $\\operatorname{lcm}\\left(k_{0}, \\ell\\right) \\geqslant k_{0}>\\ell$.

By Claim 1, for every integer $a$ each of the sequences\n\n$$\nf(a), f(a+1), \\ldots, f\\left(a+k_{0}-1\\right) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad f(a+1), f(a+2), \\ldots, f\\left(a+k_{0}\\right)\n$$\n\nforms a complete residue system modulo $k_{0}$. This yields $f(a) \\equiv f\\left(a+k_{0}\\right)\\left(\\bmod k_{0}\\right)$. Thus, $f(a) \\equiv f(b)\\left(\\bmod k_{0}\\right)$ whenever $a \\equiv b\\left(\\bmod k_{0}\\right)$.\n\nFinally, if $a \\not \\equiv b\\left(\\bmod k_{0}\\right)$ then there exists an integer $b^{\\prime}$ such that $b^{\\prime} \\equiv b\\left(\\bmod k_{0}\\right)$ and $\\left|a-b^{\\prime}\\right|<k_{0}$. Then $f(b) \\equiv f\\left(b^{\\prime}\\right) \\not \\equiv f(a)\\left(\\bmod k_{0}\\right)$. The induction step is proved.\n\nStep 2. We prove that for some small integer a there exist infinitely many integers $n$ such that $\\overline{f(n)}=$ an. In other words, $f$ is linear on some infinite set.\n\nWe start with the following general statement.\n\n\n\nClaim 2. There exists a constant $c$ such that $f(t)<c t$ for every positive integer $t>N$.\n\nProof. Let $d$ be the product of all small primes, and let $\\alpha$ be a positive integer such that $2^{\\alpha}>f(N)$. Then, for every $p \\in \\mathcal{S}$ the numbers $f(0), f(1), \\ldots, f(N)$ are distinct modulo $p^{\\alpha}$. Set $P=d^{\\alpha}$ and $c=P+f(N)$.\n\nChoose any integer $t>N$. Due to the choice of $\\alpha$, for every $p \\in \\mathcal{S}$ there exists at most one nonnegative integer $i \\leqslant N$ with $p^{\\alpha} \\mid f(t)-f(i)$. Since $|\\mathcal{S}|<N$, we can choose a nonnegative integer $j \\leqslant N$ such that $p^{\\alpha} \\nmid f(t)-f(j)$ for all $p \\in \\mathcal{S}$. Therefore, $S(f(t)-f(j))<P$.\n\nOn the other hand, Step 1 shows that $L(f(t)-f(j))=L(t-j) \\leqslant t-j$. Since $0 \\leqslant j \\leqslant N$, this yields\n\n$$\nf(t)=f(j)+L(f(t)-f(j)) \\cdot S(f(t)-f(j))<f(N)+(t-j) P \\leqslant(P+f(N)) t=c t\n$$\n\nNow let $\\mathcal{T}$ be the set of large primes. For every $t \\in \\mathcal{T}$, Step 1 implies $L(f(t))=t$, so the ratio $f(t) / t$ is an integer. Now Claim 2 leaves us with only finitely many choices for this ratio, which means that there exists an infinite subset $\\mathcal{T}^{\\prime} \\subseteq \\mathcal{T}$ and a positive integer $a$ such that $f(t)=a t$ for all $t \\in \\mathcal{T}^{\\prime}$, as required.\n\nSince $L(t)=L(f(t))=L(a) L(t)$ for all $t \\in \\mathcal{T}^{\\prime}$, we get $L(a)=1$, so the number $a$ is small.\n\nStep 3. We show that $f(x)=$ ax for all $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nLet $R_{i}=\\{x \\in \\mathbb{Z}: x \\equiv i(\\bmod N !)\\}$ denote the residue class of $i$ modulo $N !$.\n\nClaim 3. Assume that for some $r$, there are infinitely many $n \\in R_{r}$ such that $f(n)=a n$. Then $f(x)=a x$ for all $x \\in R_{r+1}$.\n\nProof. Choose any $x \\in R_{r+1}$. By our assumption, we can select $n \\in R_{r}$ such that $f(n)=$ an and $|n-x|>|f(x)-a x|$. Since $n-x \\equiv r-(r+1)=-1(\\bmod N !)$, the number $|n-x|$ is large. Therefore, by Step 1 we have $f(x) \\equiv f(n)=a n \\equiv a x(\\bmod n-x)$, so $n-x \\mid f(x)-a x$. Due to the choice of $n$, this yields $f(x)=a x$.\n\nTo complete Step 3, notice that the set $\\mathcal{T}^{\\prime}$ found in Step 2 contains infinitely many elements of some residue class $R_{i}$.

Due to symmetry it is enough for this purpose to prove $\\left|y^{2}-P(x)\\right|>2|x|$ for any two real numbers $x$ and $y$.

To reach this we let $P$ denote any polynomial satisfying (1) and $P(0) \\geqslant 0$; as we shall see, this implies $P(x)=x^{2}+1$ for all real $x$, which is actually more than what we want.\n\nFirst step: We prove that $P$ is even.\n\nBy (1) we have\n\n$$\n\\left|y^{2}-P(x)\\right| \\leqslant 2|x| \\Longleftrightarrow\\left|x^{2}-P(y)\\right| \\leqslant 2|y| \\Longleftrightarrow\\left|y^{2}-P(-x)\\right| \\leqslant 2|x|\n$$\n\nfor all real numbers $x$ and $y$.

We claim that there are infinitely many real numbers $x$ such that $P(x)+2|x| \\geqslant 0$. This holds in fact for any real polynomial with $P(0) \\geqslant 0$; in order to see this, we may assume that the coefficient of $P$ appearing in front of $x$ is nonnegative. In this case the desired inequality holds for all sufficiently small positive real numbers.\n\nFor such numbers $x$ satisfying $P(x)+2|x| \\geqslant 0$ we have $P(x)+2|x|=P(-x)+2|x|$ by the previous displayed formula, and hence also $P(x)=P(-x)$. Consequently the polynomial $P(x)-P(-x)$ has infinitely many zeros, wherefore it has to vanish identically. Thus $P$ is indeed even.\n\n\n\nSecond step: We prove that $P(t)>0$ for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nLet us assume for a moment that there exists a real number $t \\neq 0$ with $P(t)=0$. Then there is some open interval $I$ around $t$ such that $|P(y)| \\leqslant 2|y|$ holds for all $y \\in I$. Plugging $x=0$ into (1) we learn that $y^{2}=P(0)$ holds for all $y \\in I$, which is clearly absurd. We have thus shown $P(t) \\neq 0$ for all $t \\neq 0$.\n\nIn combination with $P(0) \\geqslant 0$ this informs us that our claim could only fail if $P(0)=0$. In this case there is by our first step a polynomial $Q(x)$ such that $P(x)=x^{2} Q(x)$. Applying (1) to $x=0$ and an arbitrary $y \\neq 0$ we get $|y Q(y)|>2$, which is surely false when $y$ is sufficiently small.\n\nThird step: We prove that $P$ is a quadratic polynomial.\n\nNotice that $P$ cannot be constant, for otherwise if $x=\\sqrt{P(0)}$ and $y$ is sufficiently large, the first part of (1) is false whilst the second part is true. So the degree $n$ of $P$ has to be at least 1 . By our first step $n$ has to be even as well, whence in particular $n \\geqslant 2$.\n\nNow assume that $n \\geqslant 4$. Plugging $y=\\sqrt{P(x)}$ into (1) we get $\\left|x^{2}-P(\\sqrt{P(x)})\\right| \\leqslant 2 \\sqrt{P(x)}$ and hence\n\n$$\nP(\\sqrt{P(x)}) \\leqslant x^{2}+2 \\sqrt{P(x)}\n$$\n\nfor all real $x$. Choose positive real numbers $x_{0}, a$, and $b$ such that if $x \\in\\left(x_{0}, \\infty\\right)$, then $a x^{n}<$ $P(x)<b x^{n}$; this is indeed possible, for if $d>0$ denotes the leading coefficient of $P$, then $\\lim _{x \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{P(x)}{x^{n}}=d$, whence for instance the numbers $a=\\frac{d}{2}$ and $b=2 d$ work provided that $x_{0}$ is chosen large enough.\n\nNow for all sufficiently large real numbers $x$ we have\n\n$$\na^{n / 2+1} x^{n^{2} / 2}<a P(x)^{n / 2}<P(\\sqrt{P(x)}) \\leqslant x^{2}+2 \\sqrt{P(x)}<x^{n / 2}+2 b^{1 / 2} x^{n / 2},\n$$\n\ni.e.\n\n$$\nx^{\\left(n^{2}-n\\right) / 2}<\\frac{1+2 b^{1 / 2}}{a^{n / 2+1}}\n$$\n\nwhich is surely absurd.

We claim that the winner can be decided only from the values of $a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n}$, while $a_{1}$ and $b_{1}$ are actually irrelevant. Suppose that this was not the case, and assume without loss of generality that $a_{2}<b_{2}$. Then the relative order of $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n}$ is fixed, and the position of $b_{1}$ has to decide the winner. Suppose that for some value $b_{1}=x, B$ wins, while for some other value $b_{1}=y, A$ wins.\n\nWrite $B_{x}=\\left\\{x, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n}\\right\\}$ and $B_{y}=\\left\\{y, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n}\\right\\}$, and let $\\varepsilon>0$ be smaller than half the distance between any two of the numbers in $B_{x} \\cup B_{y} \\cup A$. For any set $M$, let $M \\pm \\varepsilon$ be the set obtained by adding/subtracting $\\varepsilon$ to all elements of $M$. By our choice of $\\varepsilon$, the relative order of the elements of $\\left(B_{y}+\\varepsilon\\right) \\cup A$ is still the same as for $B_{y} \\cup A$, while the relative order of the elements of $\\left(B_{x}-\\varepsilon\\right) \\cup A$ is still the same as for $B_{x} \\cup A$. Thus $A<B_{x}-\\varepsilon$, but $A>B_{y}+\\varepsilon$. Moreover, if $y>x$, then $B_{x}-\\varepsilon \\prec B_{y}+\\varepsilon$ by condition 2, while otherwise the relative order of\n\n\n\nthe elements in $\\left(B_{x}-\\varepsilon\\right) \\cup\\left(B_{y}+\\varepsilon\\right)$ is the same as for the two sets $\\{2\\} \\cup\\{2 i-1 \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n\\}$ and $\\{1\\} \\cup\\{2 i \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n\\}$, so that $B_{x}-\\varepsilon<B_{y}+\\varepsilon$. In either case, we obtain\n\n$$\nA \\prec B_{x}-\\varepsilon \\prec B_{y}+\\varepsilon<A,\n$$\n\nwhich contradicts condition 3 .\n\nSo we know now that the winner does not depend on $a_{1}, b_{1}$. Therefore, we can define a new rule $<^{*}$ on sets of cardinality $n-1$ by saying that $A \\prec^{*} B$ if and only if $A \\cup\\{a\\} \\prec B \\cup\\{b\\}$ for some $a, b$ (or equivalently, all $a, b$ ) such that $a<\\min A, b<\\min B$ and $A \\cup\\{a\\}$ and $B \\cup\\{b\\}$ are disjoint. The rule $<^{*}$ satisfies all conditions again, so by the induction hypothesis, there exists an index $i$ such that $A \\prec^{*} B$ if and only if the $i^{\\text {th }}$ smallest element of $A$ is less than the $i^{\\text {th }}$ smallest element of $B$. This implies that $C<D$ if and only if the $(i+1)^{\\text {th }}$ smallest element of $C$ is less than the $(i+1)^{\\text {th }}$ smallest element of $D$, which completes our induction.\n\nSecond case: $(\\{2 i-1 \\mid 1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-1\\} \\cup\\{2 n\\})<(\\{2 i \\mid 1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-1\\} \\cup\\{2 n-1\\})$. Set $-A=\\{-a \\mid a \\in A\\}$ for any $A \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$. For any two disjoint sets $A, B \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$ of cardinality $n$, we write $A \\prec^{\\circ} B$ to mean $(-B) \\prec(-A)$. It is easy to see that $\\prec^{\\circ}$ defines a rule to determine a winner that satisfies the three conditions of our problem as well as the relation of the first case. So it follows in the same way as in the first case that for some $i, A \\prec^{\\circ} B$ if and only if the $i^{\\text {th }}$ smallest element of $A$ is less than the $i^{\\text {th }}$ smallest element of $B$, which is equivalent to the condition that the $i^{\\text {th }}$ largest element of $-A$ is greater than the $i^{\\text {th }}$ largest element of $-B$.

Fix a value of $x$ and note that for $y>x$ we must have $x f(x)+y f(x)>x f(y)+y f(x)>2$ (using that $f$ is decreasing for the first step), hence $f(x)>\\frac{2}{x+y}$.

Moreover, because $y$ is the only positive real number such that $(g(y), y)$ is a good pair and $x \\neq y$, we have $x f(g(y))+g(y) f(x)>$ 2.

We will thus look for the minimal possible value of the sum of all entries in $B$.\n\nWe note that any well has just one good path ending in it, consisting of just the well, and that any other field has the number of good paths ending in it equal to the sum of this quantity for all the adjacent fields with smaller values, since a good path can only come into the field from a field of lower value. Therefore, if we fill in the fields in $B$ in increasing order with respect to their values in $A$, it follows that each field not adjacent to any already filled field will receive a 1, while each field adjacent to already filled fields will receive the sum of the numbers already written on these adjacent fields.\n\nWe note that there is at least one well in $A$, that corresponding with the field with the entry 1 in $A$. Hence, the sum of values of fields in $B$ corresponding to wells in $A$ is at least 1 . We will now try to minimize the sum of the non-well entries, i.e. of the entries in $B$ corresponding to the non-wells in $A$. We note that we can ascribe to each pair of adjacent fields the value of the lower assigned number and that the sum of non-well entries will then equal to the sum of the ascribed numbers. Since the lower number is still at least 1, the sum of non-well entries will at least equal the number of pairs of adjacent fields, which is $2 n(n-1)$. Hence, the total minimum sum of entries in $B$ is at least $2 n(n-1)+1=2 n^{2}-2 n+1$. The necessary conditions for the minimum to be achieved is for there to be only one well and for no two entries in $B$ larger than 1 to be adjacent to each other.\n\nWe will now prove that the lower limit of $2 n^{2}-2 n+1$ entries can be achieved. This amounts to finding a way of marking a certain set of squares, those that have a value of 1 in $B$, such that no two unmarked squares are adjacent and that the marked squares form a connected tree with respect to adjacency.\n\nFor $n=1$ and $n=2$ the markings are respectively the lone field and the L-trimino.

If no positive integer $n$ is a grade, then $f(1,0)>f(0, n)$ for all $n$ which is impossible.\n\nSimilarly, there is an $n$ such that $f(0,1)<f(n, 0)$, thus $1 / n$ is not a grade for some large $n$.

If both $x_{1} \\geqslant x_{2}$ and $y_{1} \\geqslant y_{2}$ this is clear.\n\nSuppose $x_{1} \\geqslant x_{2}$ and $y_{1}<y_{2}$. Then $\\frac{x_{1}-x_{2}}{y_{2}-y_{1}}>\\alpha$ is a grade.

The function $f$ orders pairs $(x, y)$ based on the value of $x+y \\alpha$. If $\\alpha$ is rational, tiebreaking is done by larger $x$ - or $y$-coordinate (depending on whether $\\alpha$ is a grade).\n\n\n\nWe can imagine this the following way: take a line with slope $-\\frac{1}{\\alpha}$ under the first quadrant of the plane. And we start to move this line upward (but it stays parallel to the original line). First it hits $(0,0)$, so $f(0,0)=0$. And each time the line hits a point $p, f(p)$ is the number of points hit before. If $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, it is possible that the line hits multiple points.

We use induction on $n$. The base case $n=2$ is routine.

Clearly, these inequalities hold for $k=n$ and $k=n-1$, as $S(n, n)=S(n, n-1)>0$. In the sequel, we assume that $k<n-1$.\n\nNow the first inequality in (1) rewrites as $n S(n, k) \\geqslant k S(n, n)=k(S(n, k)+S(n-k, n-k))$, or, cancelling the terms occurring on both parts, as\n\n$$\n(n-k) S(n, k) \\geqslant k S(n-k, n-k) \\Longleftrightarrow S(n, k) \\geqslant k \\cdot \\frac{S(n-k, n-k)}{n-k}\n$$\n\nBy the induction hypothesis, we have $S(n-k, n-k) /(n-k)=m_{n-k}$. By Claim 3, we get $a_{n-i} \\geqslant m_{n-k}$ for all $i=1,2, \\ldots, k$. Summing these $k$ inequalities we obtain\n\n$$\nS(n, k) \\geqslant k m_{n-k}=k \\cdot \\frac{S(n-k, n-k)}{n-k}\n$$\n\nas required.\n\nThe second inequality in (1) is proved similarly.

In the first case, the order of the colors of the cells visited is given by $A, B, D, C, A, B, D, C, A, \\ldots$, in the second case it is $A, C, D, B, A, C, D, B, A, \\ldots$ Since the route is closed it must contain the same number of cells of each color. There are only $499^{2} A$-cells. In the following we will show that the rook cannot visit all the $A$-cells on its route and hence the maximum possible number of cells in a route is $4 \\cdot\\left(499^{2}-1\\right)$.\n\nAssume that the route passes through every single $A$-cell. Color the $A$-cells in black and white in a chessboard manner, i.e. color any two $A$-cells at distance 2 in different color. Since the number of $A$-cells is odd the rook cannot always alternate between visiting black and white $A$-cells along its route. Hence there are two $A$-cells of the same color which are four rook-steps apart that are visited directly one after the other. Let these two $A$-cells have row and column numbers $(a, b)$ and $(a+2, b+2)$ respectively.\n\n<img_3906>\n\nThere is up to reflection only one way the rook can take from $(a, b)$ to $(a+2, b+2)$. Let this way be $(a, b) \\rightarrow(a, b+1) \\rightarrow(a+1, b+1) \\rightarrow(a+1, b+2) \\rightarrow(a+2, b+2)$. Also let without loss of generality the color of the cell $(a, b+1)$ be $B$ (otherwise change the roles of columns and rows).\n\nNow consider the $A$-cell $(a, b+2)$. The only way the rook can pass through it is via $(a-1, b+2) \\rightarrow$ $(a, b+2) \\rightarrow(a, b+3)$ in this order, since according to our assumption after every $A$-cell the rook passes through a $B$-cell. Hence, to connect these two parts of the path, there must be\n\n\n\na path connecting the cell $(a, b+3)$ and $(a, b)$ and also a path connecting $(a+2, b+2)$ and $(a-1, b+2)$.\n\nBut these four cells are opposite vertices of a convex quadrilateral and the paths are outside of that quadrilateral and hence they must intersect. This is due to the following fact:\n\nThe path from $(a, b)$ to $(a, b+3)$ together with the line segment joining these two cells form a closed loop that has one of the cells $(a-1, b+2)$ and $(a+2, b+2)$ in its inside and the other one on the outside. Thus the path between these two points must cross the previous path.\n\nBut an intersection is only possible if a cell is visited twice. This is a contradiction.\n\nHence the number of cells visited is at most $4 \\cdot\\left(499^{2}-1\\right)$.\n\nThe following picture indicates a recursive construction for all $n \\times n$-chessboards with $n \\equiv 3$ mod 4 which clearly yields a path that misses exactly one $A$-cell (marked with a dot, the center cell of the $15 \\times 15$-chessboard) and hence, in the case of $n=999$ crosses exactly $4 \\cdot\\left(499^{2}-1\\right)$ cells.\n\n<img_3771>"], "answer_type": "Numerical", "subfield": "Combinatorics", "code": ["To determine the longest possible cyclic, non-intersecting route of a limp rook on a \\(999 \\times 999\\) board, we need to understand the movement constraints and the structure of the route.\n\n1. **Movement Constraints**: A limp rook can only move to adjacent squares that are perpendicular to its current direction.

Let the closed intervals $I_{k}$ and $J_{k}$ be the projections of $B_{k}$ onto the $x$ - and $y$-axis, for $1 \\leq k \\leq n$.\n\nIf $B_{i}$ and $B_{j}$ intersect, with a common point $(x, y)$, then $x \\in I_{i} \\cap I_{j}$ and $y \\in J_{i} \\cap J_{j}$.

Putting it around, $B_{i}$ and $B_{j}$ are disjoint if and only if their projections on at least one coordinate axis are disjoint.\n\nFor brevity we call two boxes or intervals adjacent if their indices differ by 1 modulo $n$, and nonadjacent otherwise.\n\nThe adjacent boxes $B_{k}$ and $B_{k+1}$ do not intersect for each $k=1, \\ldots, n$. Hence $\\left(I_{k}, I_{k+1}\\right)$ or $\\left(J_{k}, J_{k+1}\\right)$ is a pair of disjoint intervals, $1 \\leq k \\leq n$.

Then $\\Delta_{k}$ and $\\Delta_{k+1}$ are disjoint for at most three values of $k=1, \\ldots, n$.\n\nProof. Denote $\\Delta_{k}=\\left[a_{k}, b_{k}\\right], 1 \\leq k \\leq n$. Let $\\alpha=\\max \\left(a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{n}\\right)$ be the rightmost among the left endpoints of $\\Delta_{1}, \\ldots, \\Delta_{n}$, and let $\\beta=\\min \\left(b_{1}, \\ldots, b_{n}\\right)$ be the leftmost among their right endpoints. Assume that $\\alpha=a_{2}$ without loss of generality.\n\nIf $\\alpha \\leq \\beta$ then $a_{i} \\leq \\alpha \\leq \\beta \\leq b_{i}$ for all $i$. Every $\\Delta_{i}$ contains $\\alpha$, and thus no disjoint pair $\\left(\\Delta_{i}, \\Delta_{i+1}\\right)$ exists.\n\n\n\nIf $\\beta<\\alpha$ then $\\beta=b_{i}$ for some $i$ such that $a_{i}<b_{i}=\\beta<\\alpha=a_{2}<b_{2}$, hence $\\Delta_{2}$ and $\\Delta_{i}$ are disjoint. Now $\\Delta_{2}$ intersects all remaining intervals except possibly $\\Delta_{1}$ and $\\Delta_{3}$, so $\\Delta_{2}$ and $\\Delta_{i}$ can be disjoint only if $i=1$ or $i=3$. Suppose by symmetry that $i=3$; then $\\beta=b_{3}$. Since each of the intervals $\\Delta_{4}, \\ldots, \\Delta_{n}$ intersects $\\Delta_{2}$, we have $a_{i} \\leq \\alpha \\leq b_{i}$ for $i=4, \\ldots, n$.

By definition, $B=(u, v)$ satisfies this condition if and only if there is a point $C=(x, y) \\in S$ such that $\\frac{1}{2}|u y-v x|=k$. (This is a well-known formula expressing the area of triangle $A B C$ when $A$ is the origin.)\n\nTo say that there exist integers $x, y$ for which $|u y-v x|=2 k$, is equivalent to saying that the greatest common divisor of $u$ and $v$ is also a divisor of $2 k$. Summing up, a point $B=(u, v) \\in S$ is a $k$-friend of $(0,0)$ if and only if $\\operatorname{gcd}(u, v)$ divides $2 k$.\n\nTranslation by a vector with integer coordinates does not affect $k$-friendship; if two points are $k$-friends, so are their translates. It follows that two points $A, B \\in S, A=(s, t), B=(u, v)$, are $k$-friends if and only if the point $(u-s, v-t)$ is a $k$-friend of $(0,0)$; i.e., if $\\operatorname{gcd}(u-s, v-t) \\mid 2 k$.\n\nLet $n$ be a positive integer which does not divide $2 k$. We claim that a $k$-clique cannot have more than $n^{2}$ elements.\n\nIndeed, all points $(x, y) \\in S$ can be divided into $n^{2}$ classes determined by the remainders that $x$ and $y$ leave in division by $n$. If a set $T$ has more than $n^{2}$ elements, some two points $A, B \\in T, A=(s, t), B=(u, v)$, necessarily fall into the same class. This means that $n \\mid u-s$ and $n \\mid v-t$. Hence $n \\mid d$ where $d=\\operatorname{gcd}(u-s, v-t)$. And since $n$ does not divide $2 k$, also $d$ does not divide $2 k$. Thus $A$ and $B$ are not $k$-friends and the set $T$ is not a $k$-clique.\n\nNow let $M(k)$ be the least positive integer which does not divide $2 k$. Write $M(k)=m$ for the moment and consider the set $T$ of all points $(x, y)$ with $0 \\leq x, y<m$. There are $m^{2}$ of them. If $A=(s, t), B=(u, v)$ are two distinct points in $T$ then both differences $|u-s|,|v-t|$ are integers less than $m$ and at least one of them is positive. By the definition of $m$, every positive integer less than $m$ divides $2 k$. Therefore $u-s$ (if nonzero) divides $2 k$, and the same is true of $v-t$. So $2 k$ is divisible by $\\operatorname{gcd}(u-s, v-t)$, meaning that $A, B$ are $k$-friends. Thus $T$ is a $k$-clique.\n\nIt follows that the maximum size of a $k$-clique is $M(k)^{2}$, with $M(k)$ defined as above. We are looking for the minimum $k$ such that $M(k)^{2}>200$.\n\nBy the definition of $M(k), 2 k$ is divisible by the numbers $1,2, \\ldots, M(k)-1$, but not by $M(k)$ itself. If $M(k)^{2}>200$ then $M(k) \\geq 15$. Trying to hit $M(k)=15$ we get a contradiction immediately ( $2 k$ would have to be divisible by 3 and 5 , but not by 15 ).\n\nSo let us try $M(k)=16$. Then $2 k$ is divisible by the numbers $1,2, \\ldots, 15$, hence also by their least common multiple $L$, but not by 16 . And since $L$ is not a multiple of 16 , we infer that $k=L / 2$ is the least $k$ with $M(k)=16$.\n\nFinally, observe that if $M(k) \\geq 17$ then $2 k$ must be divisible by the least common multiple of $1,2, \\ldots, 16$, which is equal to $2 L$. Then $2 k \\geq 2 L$, yielding $k>L / 2$.\n\nIn conclusion, the least $k$ with the required property is equal to $L / 2=180180$."], "answer_type": "Numerical", "subfield": "Combinatorics", "code": ["To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest positive integer \\( k \\) such that there exists a \\( k \\)-clique with more than 200 elements in the set \\( S \\) of all points with integer coordinates.

This can be done in $2^{k_{\\ell}-1}$ ways (because a $k_{\\ell}$-element set has $2^{k_{\\ell}-1}$ subsets of even cardinality). Notice that $k_{1}+\\cdots+k_{n}=k$.\n\nThese actions are independent, in the sense that the action involving lamp $\\ell$ does not affect the action involving any other lamp. So there are $2^{k_{1}-1} \\cdot 2^{k_{2}-1} \\cdots 2^{k_{n}-1}=2^{k-n}$ ways of combining these actions. In any of these combinations, each one of the lamps $n+1, \\ldots, 2 n$ gets switched an even number of times and each one of the lamps $1, \\ldots, n$ remains switched an odd number of times, so the final state is the same as that resulting from the original process $\\mathbf{p}$.\n\nThis shows that every restricted admissible process $\\mathbf{p}$ can be modified in $2^{k-n}$ ways, giving rise to $2^{k-n}$ distinct admissible processes (with all lamps allowed).\n\nNow we show that every admissible process $\\mathbf{q}$ can be achieved in that way. Indeed, it is enough to replace every switch of a lamp with a label $\\ell>n$ that occurs in $\\mathbf{q}$ by the switch of the corresponding lamp $\\ell-n$; in the resulting process $\\mathbf{p}$ the lamps $n+1, \\ldots, 2 n$ are not involved.\n\nSwitches of each lamp with a label $\\ell>n$ had occurred in $\\mathbf{q}$ an even number of times. So the performed replacements have affected each lamp with a label $\\ell \\leq n$ also an even number of times; hence in the overall effect the final state of each lamp has remained the same. This means that the resulting process $\\mathbf{p}$ is admissible - and clearly restricted, as the lamps $n+1, \\ldots, 2 n$ are not involved in it any more.\n\nIf we now take process $\\mathbf{p}$ and reverse all these replacements, then we obtain process $\\mathbf{q}$. These reversed replacements are nothing else than the modifications described in the foregoing paragraphs.\n\nThus there is a one-to- $\\left(2^{k-n}\\right)$ correspondence between the $M$ restricted admissible processes and the total of $N$ admissible processes.

For $n=2012$ this gives $N_{\\min }=4022$.\n\na) If $N=2 n-2$ player $A$ can achieve her goal. Let her start the game with a regular distribution: $n-2$ boxes with 2 coins and 2 boxes with 1 coin. Call the boxes of the two kinds red and white respectively. We claim that on her first move $A$ can achieve a regular distribution again, regardless of $B$ 's first move $M$. She acts according as the following situation $S$ occurs after $M$ or not: The initial distribution contains a red box $R$ with 2 white neighbors, and $R$ receives no coins from them on move $M$.\n\nSuppose that $S$ does not occur. Exactly one of the coins $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$ in a given red box $X$ is involved in $M$, say $c_{1}$. If $M$ passes $c_{1}$ to the right neighbor of $X$, let $A$ pass $c_{2}$ to its left neighbor, and vice versa. By doing so with all red boxes $A$ performs a legal move $M^{\\prime}$. Thus $M$ and $M^{\\prime}$ combined move the 2 coins of every red box in opposite directions. Hence after $M$ and $M^{\\prime}$ are complete each neighbor of a red box $X$ contains exactly 1 coin that was initially in $X$. So each box with a red neighbor is non-empty after $M^{\\prime}$. If initially there is a box $X$ with 2 white neighbors ( $X$ is red and unique) then $X$ receives a coin from at least one of them on move $M$ since $S$ does not occur. Such a coin is not involved in $M^{\\prime}$, so $X$ is also non-empty after $M^{\\prime}$. Furthermore each box $Y$ has given away its initial content after $M$ and $M^{\\prime}$. A red neighbor of $Y$ adds 1 coin to it; a white neighbor adds at most 1 coin because it is not involved in $M^{\\prime}$. Hence each box contains 1 or 2 coins after $M^{\\prime}$. Because $N=2 n-2$, such a distribution is regular.\n\nNow let $S$ occur after move $M$. Then $A$ leaves untouched the exceptional red box $R$. With all remaining red boxes she proceeds like in the previous case, thus making a legal move $M^{\\prime \\prime}$. Box $R$ receives no coins from its neighbors on either move, so there is 1 coin in it after $M^{\\prime \\prime}$. Like above $M$ and $M^{\\prime \\prime}$ combined pass exactly 1 coin from every red box different from $R$ to each of its neighbors. Every box except $R$ has a red neighbor different from $R$, hence all boxes are non-empty after $M^{\\prime \\prime}$. Next, each box $Y$ except $R$ loses its initial content after $M$ and $M^{\\prime \\prime}$. A red neighbor of $Y$ adds at most 1 coin to it; a white neighbor also adds at most 1 coin as it does not participate in $M^{\\prime \\prime}$. Thus each box has 1 or 2 coins after $M^{\\prime \\prime}$, and the obtained distribution is regular.\n\nPlayer $A$ can apply the described strategy indefinitely, so $N=2 n-2$ enables her to succeed.\n\nb) For $N \\leq 2 n-3$ player $B$ can achieve an empty box after some move of $A$. Let $\\alpha$ be a set of $\\ell$ consecutive boxes containing a total of $N(\\alpha)$ coins. We call $\\alpha$ an $\\operatorname{arc}$ if $\\ell \\leq n-2$ and $N(\\alpha) \\leq 2 \\ell-3$. Note that $\\ell \\geq 2$ by the last condition. Moreover if both extremes of $\\alpha$ are non-empty boxes then $N(\\alpha) \\geq 2$, so that $N(\\alpha) \\leq 2 \\ell-3$ implies $\\ell \\geq 3$. Observe also that if an extreme $X$ of $\\alpha$ has more than 1 coin then ignoring $X$ yields a shorter arc. It follows that every arc contains an arc whose extremes have at most 1 coin each.\n\nGiven a clockwise labeling $1,2, \\ldots, n$ of the boxes, suppose that boxes $1,2, \\ldots, \\ell$ form an arc $\\alpha$, with $\\ell \\leq n-2$ and $N(\\alpha) \\leq 2 \\ell-3$. Suppose also that all $n \\geq 7$ boxes are non-empty. Then $B$ can move so that an arc $\\alpha^{\\prime}$ with $N\\left(\\alpha^{\\prime}\\right)<N(\\alpha)$ will appear after any response of $A$.\n\n\n\nOne may assume exactly 1 coin in boxes 1 and $\\ell$ by a previous remark. Let $B$ pass 1 coin in counterclockwise direction from box 1 and box $n$, and in clockwise direction from each remaining box. This leaves $N(\\alpha)-2$ coins in the boxes of $\\alpha$. In addition, due to $3 \\leq \\ell \\leq n-2$, box $\\ell$ has exactly 1 coin $c$, the one received from box $\\ell-1$.\n\nLet player $A$ 's next move $M$ pass $k \\leq 2$ coins to boxes $1,2, \\ldots, \\ell$ from the remaining ones. Only boxes 1 and $\\ell$ can receive such coins, at most 1 each. If $k<2$ then after move $M$ boxes $1,2, \\ldots, \\ell$ form an arc $\\alpha^{\\prime}$ with $N\\left(\\alpha^{\\prime}\\right)<N(\\alpha)$. If $k=2$ then $M$ adds a coin to box $\\ell$. Also $M$ does not move coin $c$ from $\\ell$ because $c$ is involved in the previous move of $B$. In summary boxes $1,2, \\ldots, \\ell$ contain $N(\\alpha)$ coins like before, so they form an arc. However there are 2 coins now in the extreme $\\ell$ of the arc. Ignore $\\ell$ to obtain a shorter arc $\\alpha^{\\prime}$ with $N\\left(\\alpha^{\\prime}\\right)<N(\\alpha)$.\n\nConsider any initial distribution without empty boxes. Since $N \\leq 2 n-3$, there are at least 3 boxes in it with exactly 1 coin. It follows from $n \\geq 7$ that some 2 of them are the extremes of an arc $\\alpha$. Hence $B$ can make the move described above, which leads to an arc $\\alpha^{\\prime}$ with $N\\left(\\alpha^{\\prime}\\right)<N(\\alpha)$ after $A^{\\prime}$ 's response. If all boxes in the new distribution are non-empty he can repeat the same, and so on. Because $N(\\alpha)$ cannot decrease indefinitely, an empty box will occur after some move of $A$."], "answer_type": "Numerical", "subfield": "Combinatorics", "code": ["To solve this problem, we need to analyze the game dynamics and determine the minimum number of coins \\( N \\) such that player \\( A \\) can ensure that each box always contains at least one coin after every move of hers, regardless of how player \\( B \\) plays.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - There are \\( N \\) coins and 2012 boxes arranged in a circle.\n   - Player \\( A \\) distributes the coins such that each box has at least one coin initially.\n\n2. **Player \\( B \\)'s Move:**\n   - On each of his moves, player \\( B \\) passes 1 coin from every box to an adjacent box.\n   - This means that if a box initially has \\( k \\) coins, after player \\( B \\)'s move, it will have \\( k-1 \\) coins, and the adjacent boxes will each gain 1 coin.\n\n3. **Player \\( A \\)'s Move:**\n   - On each of her moves, player \\( A \\) can choose several coins that were not involved in player \\( B \\)'s previous move and are in different boxes.\n   - She then passes every chosen coin to an adjacent box.\n\n4. **Objective:**\n   - Player \\( A \\) needs to ensure that each box always contains at least one coin after every move of hers.\n\n### Strategy for Player \\( A \\)\n\nTo ensure that each box always contains at least one coin after every move of hers, player \\( A \\) can use a strategy that involves redistributing coins in a way that maintains the minimum number of coins in each box.\n\n#### Key Insight:\n- Player \\( A \\) can strategically choose coins to pass to adjacent boxes in such a way that the total number of coins in each box remains at least 1 after every move.\n\n#### Detailed Strategy:\n1. **Initial Distribution:**\n   - Player \\( A \\) initially distributes the coins such that each box has at least one coin.\n\n2. **Maintaining Minimum Coins:**\n   - After player \\( B \\)'s move, each box will have at most \\( N - 2012 \\) coins (since each box loses 1 coin and gains 1 coin from an adjacent box).\n   - Player \\( A \\) can ensure that each box has at least 1 coin by redistributing coins strategically.\n\n3. **Redistribution Strategy:**\n   - Player \\( A \\) can choose coins from boxes that have fewer than 1 coin and pass them to adjacent boxes.\n   - This ensures that each box always has at least 1 coin after every move.\n\n### Minimum \\( N \\)\n\nTo ensure that each box always has at least 1 coin after every move, we need to consider the worst-case scenario where player \\( B \\) tries to minimize the number of coins in each box.\n\n- If \\( N = 2012 \\), player \\( B \\) can pass all coins from one box to an adjacent box, leaving each box with 1 coin.\n- If \\( N > 2012 \\), player \\( A \\) can always redistribute coins to ensure that each box has at least 1 coin.\n\nThus, the minimum \\( N \\) that ensures player \\( A \\) can always maintain at least 1 coin in each box is \\( N = 2012 \\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe least \\( N \\) that enables player \\( A \\) to succeed is \\(\\boxed{2012}\\)."], "pred": ["2012"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

Hence $y+z=503 k$ is even too, meaning that $k$ is even. Thus $k=2$ or $k=4$. Clearly (1) has no integer solutions for $k=4$. If $k=2$ then (1) takes the form $(y+z)^{2}-5 y z=4$. Since $y+z=503 k=503 \\cdot 2$, this leads to $5 y z=503^{2} \\cdot 2^{2}-4$. However $503^{2} \\cdot 2^{2}-4$ is not a multiple of 5 .

The maximum number of fat triangles is achieved when the points are arranged in a way that maximizes the number of such triangles.\n\nGiven the constraints, the maximum number of fat triangles is simply the number of triangles that can be formed, because the origin is not on any line through any two points, and thus the origin is strictly inside each triangle. Therefore, the maximum number of fat triangles is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1362364440}.\n\\]"], "pred": ["1362364440"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

Moreover, give a positive integer $n$ the $i$-th color if $n \\equiv i(3)$.\n\nBy construction we have $f(1+2)=6 \\neq 3=f(1)+f(2)$ and hence $f$ has property (ii).\n\nNow let $n, m$ be positive integers with the same color $i$. If $i=0$, then $n+m$ has color 0 , so $f(n+m)=$ $2(n+m)=2 n+2 m=f(n)+f(m)$. If $i=1$, then $n+m$ has color 2 , so $f(n+m)=n+m=f(n)+f(m)$. Finally, if $i=2$, then $n+m$ has color 1 , so $f(n+m)=n+m=f(n)+f(m)$. Therefore $f$ also satisfies condition (i).\n\nNext we show that there is no such function and coloring for $k=2$.\n\nConsider any coloring of $\\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ with 2 colors and any function $f: \\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ satisfying conditions (i) and (ii). Then there exist positive integers $m$ and $n$ such that $f(m+n) \\neq f(m)+f(n)$. Choose $m$ and $n$ such that their sum is minimal among all such $m, n$ and define $a=m+n$. Then in particular for every $b<a$ we have $f(b)=b f(1)$ and $f(a) \\neq a f(1)$.\n\nIf $a$ is even, then condition (i) for $m=n=\\frac{a}{2}$ implies $f(a)=f\\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)+f\\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)=f(1) a$, a contradiction. Hence $a$ is odd. We will prove two lemmas.\n\nLemma 1. Any odd integer $b<a$ has a different color than $a$.\n\nProof. Suppose that $b<a$ is an odd integer, and that $a$ and $b$ have the same color. Then on the one hand, $f(a+b)=f(a)+b f(1)$. On the other hand, we also have $f(a+b)=f\\left(\\frac{a+b}{2}\\right)+f\\left(\\frac{a+b}{2}\\right)=(a+b) f(1)$, as $\\frac{a+b}{2}$ is a positive integer smaller than $a$. Hence $f(a)=f(a+b)-b f(1)=(a+b) f(1)-b f(1)=a f(1)$, which is again a contradiction. Therefore all odd integers smaller than $a$ have a color different from that of $a$.\n\nLemma 2. Any even integer $b<a$ has the same color as a\n\nProof. Suppose $b<a$ is an even integer, and that $a$ and $b$ have different colors. Then $a-b$ is an odd integer smaller than $a$, so it has the same color as $b$. Thus $f(a)=f(a-b)+f(b)=(a-b) f(1)+b f(1)=a f(1)$, a contradiction. Hence all even integers smaller than $a$ have the same color as $a$.\n\nSuppose now $a+1$ has the same color as $a$. As $a>1$, we have $\\frac{a+1}{2}<a$ and therefore $f(a+1)=2 f\\left(\\frac{a+1}{2}\\right)=$ $(a+1) f(1)$. As $a-1$ is an even integer smaller than $a$, we have by Lemma 2 that $a-1$ also has the same color as $a$. Hence $2 f(a)=f(2 a)=f(a+1)+f(a-1)=(a+1) f(1)+(a-1) f(1)=2 a f(1)$, which implies that $f(a)=a f(1)$, a contradiction. So $a$ and $a+1$ have different colors.\n\nSince $a-2$ is an odd integer smaller than $a$, by Lemma 1 it has a color different from that of $a$, so $a-2$ and $a+1$ have the same color. Also, we have seen by Lemma 2 that $a-1$ and $a$ have the same color. So $f(a)+f(a-1)=f(2 a-1)=f(a+1)+f(a-2)=(a+1) f(1)+(a-2) f(1)=(2 a-1) f(1)$, from which it follows that $f(a)=(2 a-1) f(1)-f(a-1)=(2 a-1) f(1)-(a-1) f(1)=a f(1)$, which contradicts our choice of $a$ and finishes the proof.", "We prove that $k \\leq 3$ just as in first solution.\n\nNext we show that there is no such function and coloring for $k=2$.\n\nConsider any coloring of $\\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ with 2 colors and any function $f: \\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ satisfying conditions (i) and (ii). We first notice with $m=n$ that $f(2 n)=2 f(n)$.\n\nLemma 3. For every $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}, f(3 n)=3 f(n)$ holds.\n\nProof. Define $c=f(n), d=f(3 n)$. Then we have the relations\n\n$$\nf(2 n)=2 c, \\quad f(4 n)=4 c, \\quad f(6 n)=2 d\n$$\n\n- If $n$ and $2 n$ have the same color, then $f(3 n)=f(n)+f(2 n)=3 c=3 f(n)$.\n- If $n$ and $3 n$ have the same color, then $4 c=f(4 n)=f(n)+f(3 n)=c+f(3 n)$, so $f(3 n)=3 f(n)$.\n- If $2 n$ and $4 n$ have the same color, then $2 d=f(6 n)=f(2 n)+f(4 n)=2 c+4 c=6 c$, so $f(3 n)=d=3 c$.\n- Otherwise $n$ and $4 n$ have the same color, and $2 n$ and $3 n$ both have the opposite color to $n$. Therefore we compute $5 c=f(n)+f(4 n)=f(5 n)=f(2 n)+f(3 n)=2 c+f(3 n)$ so $f(3 n)=3 f(n)$.\n\nConsequently, for $k=2$ we necessarily have $f(3 n)=3 f(n)$.\n\nNow let $a$ be the smallest integer such that $f(a) \\neq a f(1)$.

Without loss of generality we may assume that $m+n, m$ are black and $n$ is white.\n\nLemma 4. For all $l \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ and every $x$ whose color is black, we have $x+l m$ is black and $f(x+\\operatorname{lm})=$ $f(x)+l f(m)$.\n\nProof. We proceed by induction. It is clearly true for $l=0$. If $x+l m$ is black and satisfies $f(x+l m)=$ $f(x)+l f(m)$, then $f(x+(l+1) m)=f(x+l m)+f(m)=f(x)+(l+1) f(m)$ and $f(x+(l+1) m+n)=$ $f(x+l m)+f(m+n)=f(x)+l f(m)+f(m+n) \\neq f(x)+(l+1) f(m)+f(n)=f(x+(l+1) m)+f(n)$, so $x+(l+1) m$ is not the same color of $n$, therefore $x+(l+1) m$ is black. Thjs completes the induction.\n\nIn particular we then must have that $2^{l} n$ is white for every $l$, because otherwise since $2^{l} m$ is black we would have $2^{l} f(m+n)=f\\left(2^{l} m+2^{l} n\\right)=f\\left(2^{l} m\\right)+f\\left(2^{l} n\\right)=2^{l}(f(m)+f(n))$, and consequently $f(m+n)=$ $f(m)+f(n)$.\n\nLemma 5. For every $l \\geq 1,2^{l} m+2^{l-1} n$ is black.\n\n\n\nProof. On the one hand we have $2^{l} f(m+n)=f\\left(2^{l} m+2^{l} n\\right)=f\\left(2^{l-1}(2 m+n)+2^{l-1} n\\right)$. On the other hand we have\n\n$\\left.2^{l} f(m+n)=2^{l-1} \\cdot 2 f(m+n) \\neq 2^{l-1}(f(m+n)+f(m)+f(n))=2^{l-1}(f(2 m+n)+f(n))=f\\left(2^{l} m+2^{l-1} n\\right)\\right)+f\\left(2^{l-1} n\\right)$.\n\nTherefore $2^{l} m+2^{l-1} n$ and $2^{l-1} n$ have different color, which means $2^{l} m+2^{l-1} n$ is black.\n\nCombining the two lemmas give $j m+2^{l-1} n$ is black for all $j \\geq 2^{l}$ and every $l \\geq 1$.\n\nNow write $m=2^{l-1} m^{\\prime}$ with $m^{\\prime}$ odd.

Indeed, if one of the sides the square had three rectangles adjacent to it, removing these three rectangles would leave a polygon with eight vertices, which is clearly not the union of two rectangles. Moreover, since $m>10$, each side of the square has at least two adjacent rectangles. Hence each side of the square has precisely two adjacent rectangles, and thus the only way of partitionning the square into five rectangles is to have a single inner rectangle and four outer rectangles each covering of the four corners of the square, as claimed.\n\nLet us now show that a square of size $12 \\times 12$ cannot be dissected in the desired way. Let $R_{1}, R_{2}, R_{3}$ and $R_{4}$ be the outer rectangles (in clockwise orientation along the\n\n\n\nboundary of the square). If an outer rectangle has a side of length $s$, then some adjacent outer rectangle must have a side of length $12-s$. Therefore, neither of $s=1$ or $s=6$ can be sidelengths of an outer rectangle, so the inner rectangle must have dimensions $1 \\times 6$. One of the outer rectangles (say $R_{1}$ ) must have dimensions $10 \\times x$, and an adjacent rectangle (say $R_{2}$ ) must thus have dimensions $2 \\times y$. Rectangle $R_{3}$ then has dimensions $(12-y) \\times z$, and rectangle $R_{4}$ has dimensions $(12-z) \\times(12-x)$. Note that exactly one of the three numbers $x, y, z$ is even (and equals 4 or 8 ), while the other two numbers are odd. Now, the total area of all five rectangles is\n\n$$\n144=6+10 x+2 y+(12-y) z+(12-z)(12-x)\n$$\n\nwhich simplifies to $(y-x)(z-2)=6$. As exactly one of the three numbers $x, y, z$ is even, the factors $y-x$ and $z-2$ are either both even or both odd, so their product cannot equal 6 , and thus there is no solution with $m=12$.\n\nFinally, we handle the cases $m=11$ and $m=13$, which indeed are solutions. The corresponding rectangle sets are $10 \\times 5,1 \\times 9,8 \\times 2,7 \\times 4$ and $3 \\times 6$ for $m=11$, and $10 \\times 5,9 \\times 8,4 \\times 6,3 \\times 7$ and $1 \\times 2$ for $m=13$. These sets can be found by trial and error. The corresponding partitions are shown in the figure below.\n<img_3324>"], "answer_type": "Numerical", "subfield": "Combinatorics", "code": ["To determine all integers \\( m \\) for which an \\( m \\times m \\) square can be dissected into five rectangles with side lengths \\( 1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 10 \\) in some order, we need to consider the area constraints and the possible dissections.\n\nFirst, calculate the total area of the five rectangles:\n\\[\n1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 55\n\\]\nThus, the area of the \\( m \\times m \\) square must be at least 55.

So, \\( m \\) must be at least 8.\n\nNext, we need to check if it is possible to dissect an \\( m \\times m \\) square into five rectangles with the given side lengths. We will start by considering the smallest possible value for \\( m \\), which is 8, and then check if it is possible to dissect an \\( m \\times m \\) square for larger values of \\( m \\).\n\n### Case \\( m = 8 \\)\nWe need to check if it is possible to dissect an \\( 8 \\times 8 \\) square into five rectangles with side lengths \\( 1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 10 \\). The total area of the five rectangles is 55, and the area of the \\( 8 \\times 8 \\) square is 64. This means we need to find a way to partition the 64 square units into five 55 square unit rectangles, which is not possible since 64 is not divisible by 55. Therefore, \\( m = 8 \\) is not possible.\n\n### Case \\( m = 9 \\)\nWe need to check if it is possible to dissect an \\( 9 \\times 9 \\) square into five rectangles with side lengths \\( 1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 10 \\). The total area of the five rectangles is 55, and the area of the \\( 9 \\times 9 \\) square is 81. This means we need to find a way to partition the 81 square units into five 55 square unit rectangles, which is not possible since 81 is not divisible by 55. Therefore, \\( m = 9 \\) is not possible.\n\n### Case \\( m = 10 \\)\nWe need to check if it is possible to dissect an \\( 10 \\times 10 \\) square into five rectangles with side lengths \\( 1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 10 \\). The total area of the five rectangles is 55, and the area of the \\( 10 \\times 10 \\) square is 100.

Therefore, \\( m = 10 \\) is not possible.\n\n### Case \\( m = 11 \\)\nWe need to check if it is possible to dissect an \\( 11 \\times 11 \\) square into five rectangles with side lengths \\( 1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 10 \\).

Consider the set of all length- $k$ strings containing only $A \\mathrm{~s}$ and $B \\mathrm{~s}$ which end with a $B$, and remove the string consisting of $k$  $B \\mathrm{~s}$. Clearly there are 2 independent choices for each of the first $k-1$ letters and 1 for the last letter, and since exactly one string is excluded, there must be exactly $2^{k-1}-1$ strings in this set.\n\nSuppose Lexi tries to fill her grid. For each row to have a valid string, it must end in a $B$. But then the right column would necessarily contain $k B \\mathrm{~s}$, and not be in our set. Thus, Lexi cannot fill her grid with our set, and we must have $m \\geqslant 2^{k-1}$.\n\nNow, consider any set $\\mathcal{S}$ with at least $2^{k-1}$ strings. Clearly, if $\\mathcal{S}$ contained either the uniform string with $k A \\mathrm{~s}$ or the string with $k B \\mathrm{~s}$, then Lexi could fill her grid with all of the relevant letters and each row and column would contain that string.\n\nConsider the case where $\\mathcal{S}$ contains neither of those strings. Among all $2^{k}$ possible length$k$ strings with $A \\mathrm{~s}$ and $B \\mathrm{~s}$, each has a complement which corresponds to the string with $B$ s in every position where first string had $A$ s and vice-versa. Clearly, the string with all $A$ s is paired with the string with all $B$ s. We may assume that we do not take the two uniform strings and thus applying the pigeonhole principle to the remaining set of strings, we must have two strings which are complementary.\n\nLet this pair of strings be $\\ell, \\ell^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{S}$ in some order. Define the set of indices $\\mathcal{J}$ corresponding to the $A \\mathrm{~s}$ in $\\ell$ and thus the $B \\mathrm{~s}$ in $\\ell^{\\prime}$, and all other indices (not in $\\mathcal{J}$ ) correspond to $B \\mathrm{~s}$ in $\\ell$ (and thus $A$ s in $\\ell^{\\prime}$ ). Then, we claim that Lexi puts an $A$ in the cell in row $r$, column $c$ if $r, c \\in \\mathcal{J}$ or $r, c \\notin \\mathcal{J}$, and a $B$ otherwise, each row and column contains a string in $\\mathcal{S}$.\n\nWe illustrate this with a simple example: If $k=6$ and we have that $A A A B A B$ and $B B B A B A$ are both in the dictionary, then Lexi could fill the table as follows:\n\n| A | A | A | B | A | B |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| A | A | A | B | A | B |\n| A | A | A | B | A | B |\n| B | B | B | A | B | A |\n| A | A | A | B | A | B |\n| B | B | B | A | B | A |\n\nSuppose we are looking at row $i$ or column $i$ for $i \\in \\mathcal{J}$. Then by construction the string in this row/column contains $A \\mathrm{~s}$ at indices $k$ with $k \\in \\mathcal{J}$ and $B$ s elsewhere, and thus is precisely $\\ell$. Suppose instead we are looking at row $i$ or column $i$ for $i \\notin \\mathcal{J}$. Then again by construction the string in this row/column contains $A$ s at indices $k$ with $k \\notin \\mathcal{J}$ and $B$ s elsewhere, and thus is precisely $\\ell^{\\prime}$. So each row and column indeed contains a string in $\\mathcal{S}$.\n\nThus, for any $\\mathcal{S}$ with $|\\mathcal{S}| \\geqslant 2^{k-1}$, Lexi can definitely fill the grid appropriately.

For example, if Kerry's list consists of the three integers $1,2,4$, the three pairwise sums are $3,5,6$.\n\n\nSuppose that $n=4$ and that the 6 pairwise sums are $s_{1}=8, s_{2}=104, s_{3}=106$, $s_{4}=110, s_{5}=112$, and $s_{6}=208$.

The six pairwise sums of the numbers in the list can be expressed as\n\n$$\na_{1}+a_{2}, a_{1}+a_{3}, a_{1}+a_{4}, a_{2}+a_{3}, a_{2}+a_{4}, a_{3}+a_{4}\n$$\n\nSince $a_{1} \\leq a_{2} \\leq a_{3} \\leq a_{4}$, then the smallest sum must be the sum of the two smallest numbers. Thus, $s_{1}=a_{1}+a_{2}$.\n\nSimilarly, the largest sum must be the sum of the two largest numbers, and so $s_{6}=a_{3}+a_{4}$.

Since a total of five 1s are used, then each arrangement corresponds with an integer with $n$ digits whose digits have a sum of 5 . Therefore, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the integers and arrangements with the desired properties.\n\nThus, $f(n)$, which equals the number of such integers, also equals the number of such arrangements.\n\nTo count the number of such arrangements, we note that there are four 1 s and $n-1 \\mathrm{Xs}$ to arrange in the final $4+(n-1)=n+3$ positions, since the first position is occupied by a 1 .\n\nThere are $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+3 \\\\ 4\\end{array}\\right)$ ways to choose the positions of the remaining four 1s, and so $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+3 \\\\ 4\\end{array}\\right)$ arrangements.\n\nThus, $f(n)=\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+3 \\\\ 4\\end{array}\\right)=\\frac{(n+3) !}{4 !(n-1) !}=\\frac{(n+3)(n+2)(n+1)(n)}{4 !}=\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{24}$.\n\nNext, we need to determine the positive integers $n$ between 1 and 2014, inclusive, for which the units digit of $f(n)$ is 1 .\n\nNow $f(n)=\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{24}$ is an integer for all positive integers $n$, since it is counting the number of things with a certain property.\n\nIf the units digit of $n$ is 0 or 5 , then $n$ is a multiple of 5 .\n\nIf the units digit of $n$ is 2 or 7 , then $n+3$ is a multiple of 5 .\n\nIf the units digit of $n$ is 3 or 8 , then $n+2$ is a multiple of 5 .\n\nIf the units digit of $n$ is 4 or 9 , then $n+1$ is a multiple of 5 .\n\nThus, if the units digit of $n$ is $0,2,3,4,5,7,8$, or 9 , then $n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)$\n\nis a multiple of 5 and so $f(n)=\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{24}$ is a multiple of 5 , since the denominator contains no factors of 5 that can divide the factor from the numerator.\n\nTherefore, if the units digit of $n$ is $0,2,3,4,5,7,8$, or 9 , then $f(n)$ is divisible by 5 , and so cannot have a units digit of 1 .\n\nSo we consider the cases where $n$ has a units digit of 1 or of 6 ; these are the only possible values of $n$ for which $f(n)$ can have a units digit of 1 .\n\nWe note that $3 f(n)=\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{8}$, which is a positive integer for all positive integers $n$.\n\n\n\nAlso, we note that if $f(n)$ has units digit 1 , then $3 f(n)$ has units digit 3 , and if $3 f(n)$ has units digit 3 , then $f(n)$ must have units digit 1 .\n\nTherefore, determining the values of $n$ for which $f(n)$ has units digit 1 is equivalent to determining the values of $n$ for which $\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{8}$ has units digit 3 .\n\nWe consider the integers $n$ in groups of 40 .

This means that $b \\leq c \\leq m-1$, so $a=2 m-b-c \\geq 2$. Therefore, $a-1, b-1$ and $c-1$ are positive integers since $a, b$ and $c$ are positive integers with $2 \\leq a \\leq b \\leq c$.\n* Since $2 \\leq a \\leq b \\leq c$, then $1 \\leq a-1 \\leq b-1 \\leq c-1$, so $0<a-1 \\leq b-1 \\leq c-1$.\n* Since $a+b+c=2 m$, then $c=2 m-(a+b)$ so $a+b$ and $c$ have the same parity.\n\nSince $c<a+b$, then $c \\leq a+b-2$. (In other words, it cannot be the case that $c=a+b-1$.) Therefore, $c-1 \\leq(a-1)+(b-1)-1$; that is, $c-1<(a-1)+(b-1)$.\n\n$*$ Since $a+b+c=2 m$, then $(a-1)+(b-1)+(c-1)=2 m-3$.\n\nTherefore, $(a-1, b-1, c-1)$ is in $S_{2 m-3}$, since it satisfies all of the conditions of $S_{2 m-3}$. Note as well that two different triples in $S_{2 m}$ correspond to two different triples in $S_{2 m-3}$. Thus, every triple in $S_{2 m}$ corresponds to a different triple in $S_{2 m-3}$.\n\nThus, $T(2 m) \\leq T(2 m-3)$.\n\nConsider a triple $(A, B, C)$ in $S_{2 m-3}$ and a corresponding triple $(A+1, B+1, C+1)$. We show that $(A+1, B+1, C+1)$ is in $S_{2 m}$ :\n\n* Since $(A, B, C)$ is in $S_{2 m-3}$, then $A, B$ and $C$ are positive integers, so $A+1, B+1$ and $C+1$ are positive integers.\n* Since $0<A \\leq B \\leq C$, then $1<A+1 \\leq B+1 \\leq C+1$, so $0<A+1 \\leq B+1 \\leq C+1$.\n* Since $C<A+B$, then $C+1<(A+1)+(B+1)-1$ so $C+1<(A+1)+(B+1)$.\n* Since $A+B+C=2 m-3$, then $(A+1)+(B+1)+(C+1)=2 m$.\n\nTherefore, $(A+1, B+1, C+1)$ is in $S_{2 m}$.\n\nNote again that two different triples in $S_{2 m-3}$ correspond to two different triples in $S_{2 m}$. Thus, every triple in $S_{2 m-3}$ corresponds to a different triple in $S_{2 m}$.\n\nTherefore, $T(2 m-3) \\leq T(2 m)$.\n\nSince $T(2 m) \\leq T(2 m-3)$ and $T(2 m-3) \\leq T(2 m)$, then $T(2 m)=T(2 m-3)$.\n\n\nNext, we prove (F2):\n\nConsider a triple $(a, b, c)$ in $S_{k}$ and a corresponding triple $(a, b+1, c+1)$. We show that the triple $(a, b+1, c+1)$ is in $S_{k+2}$ :\n\n* Since $a, b$ and $c$ are positive integers, then $a, b+1$ and $c+1$ are positive integers.\n\n\n\n* Since $0<a \\leq b \\leq c$, then $0<a \\leq b+1 \\leq c+1$.\n* Since $c<a+b$, then $c+1<a+(b+1)$.\n\n$*$ Since $a+b+c=k$, then $a+(b+1)+(c+1)=k+2$.\n\nTherefore, $(a, b+1, c+1)$ is in $S_{k+2}$. Note that, using this correspondence, different triples in $S_{k}$ correspond different triples in $S_{k+2}$. Thus, every triple in $S_{k}$ corresponds to a different triple in $S_{k+2}$. This proves that $T(k) \\leq T(k+2)$.\n\nSuppose that $n=N$ is the smallest positive integer for which $T(n)>2010$.\n\nThen $N$ must be odd:\n\nIf $N$ was even, then by (F1), $T(N-3)=T(N)>2010$ and so $n=N-3$ would be an integer smaller than $N$ with $T(n)>2010$. This contradicts the fact that $n=N$ is the smallest such integer.\n\nTherefore, we want to find the smallest odd positive integer $N$ for which $T(N)>2010$. Next, we note that if we can find an odd positive integer $n$ such that $T(n)>2010 \\geq$ $T(n-2)$, then we will have found the desired value of $n$ :\n\nThis is because $n$ and $n-2$ are both odd, and by property (F2), any smaller odd positive integer $k$ will give $T(k) \\leq T(n-2) \\leq 2010$ and any larger odd positive integer $m$ will give $T(m) \\geq T(n)>2010$.\n\nWe show that $N=309$ is the desired value of $N$ by showing that $T(309)>2010$ and $T(307) \\leq 2010$.\n\nCalculation of $T(309)$\n\nWe know that $\\frac{309}{3} \\leq c<\\frac{309}{2}$, so $103 \\leq c \\leq 154$.\n\nFor each admissible value of $c$, we need to count the number of pairs of positive integers $(a, b)$ with $a \\leq b \\leq c$ and $a+b=309-c$.\n\nFor example, if $c=154$, then we need $a \\leq b \\leq 154$ and $a+b=155$.\n\nThis gives pairs $(1,154),(2,153), \\ldots,(76,79),(77,78)$, of which there are 77 .\n\nAlso, if $c=153$, then we need $a \\leq b \\leq 153$ and $a+b=156$.\n\nThis gives pairs $(3,153), \\ldots,(77,79),(78,78)$, of which there are 76 .\n\nIn general, if $c$ is even, then the minimum possible value of $a$ occurs when $b$ is as large as possible - that is, when $b=c$, so $a \\geq 309-2 c$.\n\nAlso, the largest possible value of $a$ occurs when $a$ and $b$ are as close to equal as possible. Since $c$ is even, then $309-c$ is odd, so $a$ and $b$ cannot be equal, but they can differ by 1 . In this case, $a=154-\\frac{1}{2} c$ and $b=155-\\frac{1}{2} c$.\n\nTherefore, if $c$ is even, there are $\\left(154-\\frac{1}{2} c\\right)-(309-2 c)+1=\\frac{3}{2} c-154$ possible pairs $(a, b)$ and so $\\frac{3}{2} c-154$ possible triples.\n\nIn general, if $c$ is odd, then the minimum possible value of $a$ occurs when $b$ is as large as possible - that is, when $b=c$, so $a \\geq 309-2 c$.\n\nAlso, the largest possible value of $a$ occurs when $a$ and $b$ are as close to equal as possible.\n\nSince $c$ is odd, then $309-c$ is even, so $a$ and $b$ can be equal.

Thus, $T(n)$ is roughly equal to $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the sum of the integers from 1 to $\\frac{1}{4} n$. Therefore, $T(n) \\approx \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{4} n\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{4} n+1\\right) \\approx \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{4} n\\right)^{2} \\approx \\frac{1}{48} n^{2}$.\n\nIt makes sense to look for an odd positive integer $n$ with $T(n) \\approx 2010$.\n\nThus, we are looking for a value of $n$ that roughly satisfies $\\frac{1}{48} n^{2} \\approx 2010$ or $n^{2} \\approx 96480$ or $n \\approx 310$.\n\nSince $n$ is odd, then it makes sense to consider $n=309$, as in the solution above."], "answer_type": "Numerical", "subfield": "Combinatorics", "code": ["To determine the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) such that \\( T(n) > 2010 \\), we need to count the number of triangles with integer side lengths and a given perimeter \\( n \\).

(Notice that we can't move elements either into $A$ or $B$, or out of $C$.) We will use the notation $|C|$ to denote the sum of the elements of $C$.\n\nSince we are considering the case of $n$ even and we want to examine multiples of 3 less than or equal to $n$, it makes sense to consider $n$ as having one of the three forms $6 k$, $6 k+2$ or $6 k+4$. (These forms allow us to quickly tell what the greatest multiple of 3 less than $n$ is.)\n\nCase 1: $n=6 k$\n\nIn this case, $C$ contains at least the integers $3,6,9, \\ldots, 6 k$, and so the sum of $C$ is greater than one-third of the sum of the integers from 1 to $n$, since if we divide the integers from 1 to $n=6 k$ into groups of 3 consecutive integers starting with 1,2, 3 , then the set $C$ will always contain the largest of the 3 .\n\n\n\nCase 2: $n=6 k+4$\n\nHere, the sum of the integers from 1 to $n=6 k+4$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(6 k+4)(6 k+5)=18 k^{2}+27 k+10=3\\left(6 k^{2}+9 k+3\\right)+1$, which is never divisible by 3 . Therefore, $n$ cannot be savage in this case because the integers from 1 to $n$ cannot be partitioned into 3 sets with equal sums.\n\nCase 3: $n=6 k+2$\n\nHere, the sum of the integers from 1 to $n=6 k+2$ is\n\n$\\frac{1}{2}(6 k+2)(6 k+3)=18 k^{2}+15 k+3$, so the sum of the elements of each of the sets $A, B$ and $C$ should be $6 k^{2}+5 k+1$, so that the sums are equal.\n\nIn this case $C$, contains at least the integers $3,6,9, \\ldots, 6 k$, and so $|C| \\geq 3+6+9+\\cdots 6 k=3(1+2+3+\\cdots+2 k)=3\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(2 k)(2 k+1)\\right)=6 k^{2}+3 k$\n\nThe set $A$ contains at most the integers $1,3,5,7, \\ldots, 6 k+1$, but does not contain the odd multiples of 3 less than $n$, ie. the integers $3,9,15, \\ldots, 6 k-3$. Therefore, $|A| \\leq(1+3+5+\\cdots+6 k+1)-(3+9+\\cdots+6 k-3)$\n\n$=\\frac{1}{2}(3 k+1)[1+6 k+1]-\\frac{1}{2}(k)[3+6 k-3]$\n\n$=(3 k+1)(3 k+1)-k(3 k)$\n\n$=6 k^{2}+6 k+1$\n\n(To compute the sum of each of these arithmetic sequences, we use the fact that the sum of an arithmetic sequence is equal to half of the number of terms times the sum of the first and last terms.)\n\nThe set $B$ contains at most the integers $2,4,6,8, \\ldots, 6 k+2$, but does not contain the even multiples of 3 less than $n$, ie. the integers $6,12, \\ldots, 6 k$. Therefore, $|B| \\leq(2+4+6+\\cdots+6 k+2)-(6+12+\\cdots+6 k)$\n\n$=\\frac{1}{2}(3 k+1)[2+6 k+2]-\\frac{1}{2}(k)[6+6 k]$\n\n$=(3 k+1)(3 k+2)-k(3 k+3)$\n\n$=6 k^{2}+6 k+2$\n\nThus, the set $C$ is $2 k+1$ short of the desired sum, while the set $A$ has a sum that is $k$ too big and the set $B$ has a sum that is $k+1$ too big.\n\nSo in order to correct this, we would like to move elements from $A$ adding to $k$, and elements from $B$ which add to $k+1$ all to set $C$.\n\n\n\nSince we are assuming that $n$ is savage, then this is possible, which means that $k+1$ must be even since every element in $B$ is even, so the sum of any number of elements of $B$ is even.\n\nTherefore, $k$ is odd, and so $k=2 l+1$ for some integer $l$, and so\n\n$n=6(2 l+1)+2=12 l+8$, ie. $\\frac{n+4}{12}$ is an integer.\n\nHaving examined all cases, we see that if $n$ is an even savage integer, then $\\frac{n+4}{12}$ is an integer.\n\n\nFrom the proof of (b) above, the only possible even savage integers less than 100 are those satisfying the condition that $\\frac{n+4}{12}$ is an integer, ie. $8,20,32,44,56,68,80,92$. We already know that 8 is savage, so we examine the remaining 7 possibilities.\n\nWe make a table of the possibilities, using the notation from the proof of (b):\n\n| $n$ | $k$ | Sum of elements <br> to remove from $A$ | Sum of elements <br> to remove from $B$ | Possible? |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| 20 | 3 | 3 | 4 | No - cannot remove a sum of 3 from <br> A. |\n| 32 | 5 | 5 | 6 | Yes - remove 5 from $A, 2$ and 4 <br> from $B$ |\n| 44 | 7 | 7 | 8 | Yes - remove 7 from $A, 8$ from $B$ |\n| 56 | 9 | 9 | 10 | No - cannot remove a sum of 9 from <br> A. |\n| 68 | 11 | 11 | 12 | Yes - remove 11 from $A, 4$ and 8 <br> from $B$ |\n| 80 | 13 | 13 | 14 | Yes - remove 13 from $A, 14$ from $B$ |\n| 92 | 15 | 15 | 16 | No - cannot remove a sum of 15 <br> from $A$ (since could only use $1,5,7$, <br> 11,13 ) |\n\nTherefore, the only even savage integers less than 100 are 8, 32, 44, 68 and 80."], "answer_type": "Numerical", "subfield": "Algebra", "code": ["To determine all even savage integers \\( n \\) less than 100, we need to analyze the conditions given for a positive integer \\( n \\) to be \"savage\".

Note that every $\\operatorname{ESE}(2 k-1)$ is an $\\operatorname{ESE}(2 k)$.\n\nTherefore, the number of sequences in this case is $A(2 k-1)$.\n\nThus, $A(2 k)=A(2 k-1)+B(2 k-1)$.\n\n(iv) $\\operatorname{An} \\operatorname{ESO}(2 k+1)$ is either the one term sequence $2 k+1$, or includes $2 k+1$ and more terms, or does not include $2 k+1$.\n\nThere is 1 sequence of the first kind.\n\nAs in (iii), there are $A(2 k)$ sequences of the second kind and $B(2 k)$ sequences of the third kind.\n\nThus, $B(2 k+1)=1+A(2 k)+B(2 k)$.\n\nCombining these facts, for each positive integer $k$, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ne(2 k+1) & =A(2 k+1)+B(2 k+1) \\\\\n& =A(2 k)+(A(2 k)+B(2 k)+1) \\\\\n& =(A(2 k)+B(2 k))+A(2 k)+1 \\\\\n& =e(2 k)+(A(2 k-1)+B(2 k-1))+1 \\\\\n& =e(2 k)+e(2 k-1)+1\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ne(2 k) & =A(2 k)+B(2 k) \\\\\n& =(A(2 k-1)+B(2 k-1))+B(2 k-1) \\\\\n& =e(2 k-1)+(A(2 k-2)+B(2 k-2)+1) \\\\\n& =e(2 k-1)+e(2 k-2)+1\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTherefore, for all positive integers $n \\geq 3$, we have $e(n)=e(n-1)+e(n-2)+1$, as required.\n\n\n\nMethod 2 \n\nLet $n$ be a positive integer with $n \\geq 3$, and consider the $\\operatorname{ES}(n)$.\n\nWe divide the sequences into three sets:\n\n(i) The sequence 1 (there is 1 such sequence)\n\n(ii) The sequences which begin with 1 and have more than 1 term\n\n(iii) The sequences which do not begin with 1\n\nWe show that in case (ii) there are $e(n-1)$ sequences and in case (iii) there are $e(n-2)$ sequences.

Each of the resulting sequences is distinct, includes numbers from the set $\\{1,2,3, \\ldots, n-1\\}$, is increasing, and has odd terms in odd positions and even terms in even positions (since each term has been reduced by 1). Also, each sequence in $R$ can be obtained in this way (since adding 1 to each term in one of these ES gives a distinct sequence in $Q$ ).\n\nTherefore, the number of sequences in this case is $e(n-1)$.\n\n(iii) Consider the set of $\\operatorname{ES}(n)$ that do not begin with 1 .

Each of the resulting sequences is distinct, includes numbers from the set $\\{1,2,3, \\ldots, n-2\\}$, is increasing, and has odd terms in odd positions and even terms in even positions (since each term has been reduced by 2).

To get from $W(0,0)$ to $C(a, 2 a)$, we go up $2 a$ and right $a$.\n\nThus, to get from $C(a, 2 a)$ to $X$, we go left $2 a$ and up $a$.\n\nTherefore, the coordinates of $X$ are $(a-2 a, 2 a+a)$ or $(-a, 3 a)$.\n\nThus, the slope of $W X$ is $\\frac{3 a-0}{-a-0}=-3$.\n\nSince $X Y$ is perpendicular to $W X$, then its slope is the negative reciprocal of -3 , which is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThe sum of the slopes of $W X$ and $X Y$ is $-3+\\frac{1}{3}=-\\frac{8}{3}$."], "answer_type": "Numerical", "subfield": "Geometry", "code": ["To solve the problem, we need to determine the sum of the slopes of the sides \\(WX\\) and \\(XY\\) of the square \\(WXYZ\\) given that the diagonal \\(WY\\) has a slope of 2.\n\nFirst, let's place the square \\(WXYZ\\) on the coordinate plane for convenience.

The center of the hemispherical bubble is at the center of the spherical marbles. The distance from the center of the hemispherical bubble to the center of any of the spherical marbles is the radius of the hemispherical bubble minus the radius of the spherical marble.

The hypotenuse of this right triangle is the radius of the hemispherical bubble, which is 1. The other two sides of the right triangle are the radius of the spherical marble, \\( r \\), and the distance from the center of the hemispherical bubble to the point where the marble touches the hemispherical bubble, which is \\( 1 - r \\).

{"idx": 394, "question": "Positive integers $x, y, z$ satisfy $x y+z=160$. Compute the smallest possible value of $x+y z$.", "gt_cot": "None", "gt": "50", "unit": null, "solution": ["First consider the problem with $x, y, z$ positive real numbers. If $x y+z=160$ and $z$ is constant, then $y=\\frac{160-z}{x}$, yielding $x+y z=x+\\frac{z(160-z)}{x}$. For $a, x>0$, the quantity $x+\\frac{a}{x}$ is minimized when $x=\\sqrt{a}$ (proof: use the Arithmetic-Geometric Mean Inequality $\\frac{A+B}{2} \\geq \\sqrt{A B}$ with $A=x$ and $\\left.B=\\frac{a}{x}\\right)$; in this case, $x+\\frac{a}{x}=2 \\sqrt{a}$. Thus $x+y z \\geq 2 \\sqrt{z(160-z)}$. Considered as a function of $z$, this lower bound is increasing for $z<80$.\n\nThese results suggest the following strategy: begin with small values of $z$, and find a factorization of $160-z$ such that $x$ is close to $\\sqrt{z(160-z)}$.

If $f:[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] \\rightarrow[2,3,4,5,1,7,8,6,9,10]$, then $f$ has one cycle of period 5 and one cycle of period 3 , so the period of $f$ is 15 .

So $s_{1}=s_{0}$, and for all $n, s_{n}=s_{n+1}$; in short, the period of $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ is just 1 .\n\nIn order for $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ to have a period greater than $1, f$ must be many-to-one, so that some values occur more than once (and some values do not occur at all) in the sum $f(1)+f(2)+\\cdots+f(10)$ (or, in the original problem, $f(1)+f(2)+\\cdots+f(20)$ ). For example, consider the function $f_{2}$ below:\n\n$$\nf_{2}:[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] \\rightarrow[2,3,4,5,1,10,9,10,7,3]\n$$\n\nNote that $s_{1}=2+3+4+5+1+10+9+10+7+3 \\neq 55$, so $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ is not immediately periodic. But $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ is eventually periodic, as the following argument shows. The function $f_{2}$ has two cycles: $1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow 4 \\rightarrow 5 \\rightarrow 1$, and $7 \\rightarrow 9 \\rightarrow 7$. There are also two paths that meet up with the first cycle: $6 \\rightarrow 10 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow \\cdots$ and $8 \\rightarrow 10 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow \\cdots$. Thus for all $k$ in $T, f_{2}\\left(f_{2}(k)\\right)$ is an element of one of these two extended cycles. Thus $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ eventually becomes periodic.\n\nThe criterion that the function be many-to-one is necessary, but not sufficient, for $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ to have period greater than 1 . To see why, consider the function $g:[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] \\rightarrow$ $[2,3,4,5,6,1,8,7,8,7]$. This function is many-to-one, and contains two cycles, $1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow$ $3 \\rightarrow 4 \\rightarrow 5 \\rightarrow 6 \\rightarrow 1$ and $7 \\rightarrow 8 \\rightarrow 7$. But because $g(9)=8$ and $g(10)=7$, the sum $s_{1}=2+3+4+5+6+1+8+7+8+7$, while $s_{2}=3+4+5+6+1+2+7+8+7+8$. In fact, for $n>1, s_{n+1}=s_{n}$, because applying $f$ only permutes the 6 -cycle and switches the two 7 's and two 8's. That is, in the list $\\underbrace{(g \\circ \\cdots \\circ g)}_{n}(1), \\ldots, \\underbrace{(g \\circ \\cdots \\circ g)}_{n}(10)$, the values 7 and 8 both show up exactly twice. This cycle is balanced: each of its elements shows up the same number of times for all $n$ in the list $\\underbrace{(g \\circ \\cdots \\circ g)}_{n}(1), \\ldots, \\underbrace{(g \\circ \\cdots \\circ g)}_{n}(10)$, for all $n$ after a certain point. The conclusion is that not all many-to-one functions produce unbalanced cycles.\n\nThere are two ways a function $g$ can produce balanced cycles. First, the cycles can be selfcontained, so no element outside of the cycle is ever absorbed into the cycle, as happens with the 6-cycle in the example above. Alternatively, the outside elements that are absorbed into a cycle can all arrive at different points of the cycle, so that each element of the cycle occurs equally often in each iteration of $g$. In the example above, the values $g(9)=7$ and $g(10)=8$ balance the $7 \\rightarrow 8 \\rightarrow 7$ cycle. On the other hand, in the function $f_{2}$ above, $f(f(6))=f(f(8))=f(f(1))=3$, making the large cycle unbalanced: in $s_{2}$, the value 3 appears three times in $s_{2}$, but the value 2 only appears once in $s_{2}$.\n\nThe foregoing shows that only unbalanced cycles can affect the periodicity of $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$. Because each element of a balanced cycle occurs equally often in each iteration, the period of that component of the sum $s_{n}$ attributed to the cycle is simply 1. (The case where $f$ is a permutation of $S$ is simply a special case of this result.) In the above example, the large cycle is\n\n\n\nunbalanced. Note the following results under $f_{2}$.\n\n| $n$ | $\\overbrace{\\left(f_{2} \\circ \\cdots \\circ f_{2}\\right)}^{n}(T)$ | $s_{n}$ |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| 1 | $[2,3,4,5,1,10,9,10,7,3]$ | 54 |\n| 2 | $[3,4,5,1,2,3,7,3,9,4]$ | 41 |\n| 3 | $[4,5,1,2,3,4,9,4,7,5]$ | 40 |\n| 4 | $[5,1,2,3,4,5,7,5,9,1]$ | 42 |\n| 5 | $[1,2,3,4,5,1,9,1,7,2]$ | 35 |\n| 6 | $[2,3,4,5,1,2,7,2,9,3]$ | 38 |\n| 7 | $[3,4,5,1,2,3,9,3,7,4]$ | 41 |\n| 8 | $[4,5,1,2,3,4,7,4,9,5]$ | 40 |\n| 9 | $[5,1,2,3,4,5,9,5,7,1]$ | 42 |\n\nThe period of $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ for $f_{2}$ is 5 , the period of the unbalanced cycle.\n\nThe interested reader may inquire whether all unbalanced cycles affect the periodicity of $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$; we encourage those readers to explore the matter independently. For the purposes of solving this problem, it is sufficient to note that unbalanced cycles can affect $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ 's periodicity.\n\nFinally, note that an unbalanced $k$-cycle actually requires at least $k+1$ elements: $k$ to form the cycle, plus at least 1 to be absorbed into the cycle and cause the imbalance. For the original set $S$, one way to create such an imbalance would be to have $f(20)=f(1)=$ $2, f(2)=3, f(3)=4, \\ldots, f(19)=1$. This arrangement creates an unbalanced cycle of length 19. But breaking up into smaller unbalanced cycles makes it possible to increase the period of $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ even more, because then in most cases the period is the least common multiple of the periods of the unbalanced cycles. For example, $f:[1,2,3, \\ldots, 20]=$ $[2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,1,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,11,11,11]$ has an unbalanced cycle of length 9 and an unbalanced cycle of length 8 , giving $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ a period of 72 .\n\nSo the goal is to maximize $\\operatorname{lcm}\\left\\{k_{1}, k_{2}, \\ldots, k_{m}\\right\\}$ such that $k_{1}+k_{2}+\\cdots+k_{m}+m \\leq 20$. With $m=2$, the maximal period is 72 , achieved with $k_{1}=9$ and $k_{2}=8$. With $m=3$, $k_{1}+k_{2}+k_{3} \\leq 17$, but $\\operatorname{lcm}\\{7,6,4\\}=84<\\operatorname{lcm}\\{7,5,4\\}=140$. This last result can be obtained with unbalanced cycles of length 4,5 , and 7 , with the remaining four points entering the three cycles (or with one point forming a balanced cycle of length 1, i.e., a fixed point). Choosing larger values of $m$ decreases the values of $k$ so far that they no longer form long cycles: when $m=4, k_{1}+k_{2}+k_{3}+k_{4} \\leq 16$, and even if $k_{4}=2, k_{3}=3$, and $k_{2}=5$, for a period of 30 , the largest possible value of $k_{1}=6$, which does not alter the period. (Even $k_{1}=7, k_{2}=5$, and $k_{3}=k_{4}=2$ only yields a period of 70 .) Thus the maximum period of $s_{n}$ is $\\mathbf{1 4 0}$. One such function $f$ is given below.\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cccccccccccccccccccc}\nn & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 & 13 & 14 & 15 & 16 & 17 & 18 & 19 & 20 \\\\\n\\hline f(n) & 2 & 3 & 4 & 1 & 1 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 6 & 6 & 13 & 14 & 15 & 16 & 17 & 18 & 12 & 12 & 20\n\\end{array}\n$$"], "answer_type": "Numerical", "subfield": "Algebra", "code": ["To solve the problem, we need to analyze the sequence \\( s_n \\) defined by \\( s_n = \\sum_{k=1}^{20} f^{(n)}(k) \\), where \\( f^{(n)}(k) \\) denotes the \\( n \\)-fold composition of \\( f \\) with itself applied to \\( k \\).

From the Pythagorean Theorem, it follows that $O_{1} H_{1}=2 \\sqrt{r r_{1}}$ and $O_{2} H_{2}=2 \\sqrt{r r_{2}}$.

Exactly one number in such a sequence will be a multiple of 5 , but that number could also be a multiple of 2 and hence share a common factor with at least one other number in the sequence. There are several cases to consider, namely whether the sequence starts with an even number or an odd number.\n\nIf the sequence starts with an even number, then the second and fourth numbers are both odd, and at least one of them is not a multiple of 3 and hence is relatively prime to all other numbers in the sequence because it is neither a multiple of 2 nor 3 and hence is at least 5 away from the nearest integer with a common factor. Thus the sequence contains a cromulent element.\n\nIf the sequence starts with an odd number, then again, it contains an odd number that is not a multiple of 3 and hence is relatively prime to all other numbers in the sequence, thus the sequence contains a cromulent element. In fact, it contains two such numbers if the first or last number is a multiple of 3 , and if the middle number is a multiple of 3 , then all three odd elements are cromulent.\n\n\nThe minimum number is 1 and the maximum number is 2 .

To see this, first note that a list with one number has the same median and mode.

\\).\n\nLet's try a list of length \\( 2n+1 \\) and see if we can satisfy all conditions.\n\n#### Example List: \\( 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3,

From the sine area formula with respect to $\\angle B A D^{\\prime}$ and $\\angle B^{\\prime} D C$, respectively,\n\n$$\n\\left[B A D^{\\prime}\\right]=\\frac{1}{2} x y|\\sin (2 \\alpha)|, \\quad\\left[B^{\\prime} D C\\right]=\\frac{1}{2} x(x-y) \\sin \\alpha\n$$\n\nThus\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} x(x+y) \\sin \\alpha=\\frac{1}{2} x y|\\sin (2 \\alpha)|=\\frac{1}{2} x(x-y) \\sin \\alpha .\n$$\n\n\nBecause $\\overline{B C}, \\overline{A B^{\\prime}}$, and $\\overline{D^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}}$ are all parallel, it follows that $\\triangle B C C^{\\prime}$ and $\\triangle B C D^{\\prime}$ have the same height with respect to base $\\overline{B C}$, and thus $\\left[B C C^{\\prime}\\right]=\\left[B C D^{\\prime}\\right]$. Therefore $\\left[B C D^{\\prime}\\right]=\\left[A B D^{\\prime}\\right]$, and it follows that triangles $B C D^{\\prime}$ and $A B D^{\\prime}$ have the same height with respect to base $\\overline{B D^{\\prime}}$. Thus $A$ and $C$ are equidistant from $\\overleftrightarrow{B D^{\\prime}}$. Let $M$ be the midpoint of $\\overline{A C}$. Consider the following two cases.\n\nCase 1: Suppose that $\\alpha<90^{\\circ}$. Because $A$ and $C$ are equidistant from $\\overleftrightarrow{B D^{\\prime}}$, it follows that $M$ lies on $\\overleftrightarrow{B D^{\\prime}}$. But $\\overleftrightarrow{B D}$ also passes through the midpoint of $\\overline{A C}$ by parallelogram properties, so it follows that $D$ must lie on $\\overline{B D^{\\prime}}$. This implies that $\\left[A B D^{\\prime}\\right]$ must also equal $\\frac{y^{2} \\sin \\alpha}{2}+\\frac{x y \\sin \\alpha}{2}=\\frac{\\left(x y+y^{2}\\right) \\sin \\alpha}{2}$.\n\nThus $x(x-y) \\sin \\alpha=x y \\sin 2 \\alpha=\\left(x y+y^{2}\\right) \\sin \\alpha$, which implies $x: y=\\sqrt{2}+1$ and $\\sin \\alpha=\\cos \\alpha=\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$. Finally, from right triangle $D^{\\prime} A B$ with legs in the ratio $1: \\sqrt{2}+1$, it follows that $\\tan (\\angle A B D)=\\tan \\left(\\angle A B D^{\\prime}\\right)=$ $\\sqrt{2}-1$.\n\nCase 2: Suppose that $\\alpha>90^{\\circ}$. The points $D$ and $D^{\\prime}$ lie on opposite sides of $\\overleftrightarrow{A B}$. Because $B C=A D^{\\prime}$ and points $A$ and $C$ are equidistant from $\\overleftrightarrow{B D^{\\prime}}$, it follows that $A C B D^{\\prime}$ is either a parallelogram or an isosceles trapezoid. It cannot be the former because that would imply that $\\overleftrightarrow{D^{\\prime} A}\\|\\overleftrightarrow{B C}\\| \\overleftrightarrow{A D}$. Thus $A C B D^{\\prime}$ is an isosceles trapezoid. Then $\\left[B A D^{\\prime}\\right]=\\left[B M D^{\\prime}\\right]$. Because $B, M$, and $D$ are collinear and $B D: B M=2$, it follows that $\\left[B D D^{\\prime}\\right]=2 \\cdot\\left[B M D^{\\prime}\\right]$. Moreover, $\\left[B D D^{\\prime}\\right]=\\left[B A D^{\\prime}\\right]+[B A D]+\\left[D A D^{\\prime}\\right]$, so $\\left[B A D^{\\prime}\\right]=[B A D]+\\left[D A D^{\\prime}\\right]$. Thus $\\left[B A D^{\\prime}\\right]=\\frac{x y \\sin \\alpha}{2}+\\frac{y^{2} \\sin \\alpha}{2}=\\frac{\\left(x y+y^{2}\\right) \\sin \\alpha}{2}$.\n\nThus $x(x-y) \\sin \\alpha=-x y \\sin 2 \\alpha=\\left(x y+y^{2}\\right) \\sin \\alpha$, which implies $x: y=\\sqrt{2}+1, \\sin \\alpha=\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$, and $\\cos \\alpha=-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$, so $\\alpha=135^{\\circ}$. Let $H$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $D$ to $\\overleftrightarrow{A B}$. Then $A D H$ is a $45^{\\circ}-45^{\\circ}-90^{\\circ}$ triangle with $H A=H D=\\frac{y}{\\sqrt{2}}$. Thus\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\tan \\angle A B D & =\\frac{D H}{B H}=\\frac{D H}{B A+A H} \\\\\n& =\\frac{y / \\sqrt{2}}{x+y / \\sqrt{2}}=\\frac{y}{x \\sqrt{2}+y} \\\\\n& =\\frac{y}{y(\\sqrt{2}+1)(\\sqrt{2})+y} \\\\\n& =\\frac{1}{(\\sqrt{2}+1)(\\sqrt{2})+1} \\\\\n& =\\frac{\\mathbf{3}-\\sqrt{\\mathbf{2}}}{\\mathbf{7}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$"], "answer_type": "Numerical", "subfield": "Geometry", "code": ["To solve the problem, we need to analyze the given conditions and use geometric properties of the parallelogram and the rotation.\n\nGiven:\n1. Parallelogram \\(ABCD\\) is rotated about \\(A\\) to form \\(AB'C'D'\\).\n2. \\(D\\) is on \\(\\overline{AB'}\\).\n3. \\(\\left[B'C'D\\right] = \\left[AB'D'\\right] = \\left[BCC'\\right]\\).\n\nFirst, let's understand the implications of the given equal areas. The area of a triangle is given by \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\\). The equal areas imply that the heights from the vertices to the opposite sides are proportional to the lengths of the sides.\n\nSince \\(ABCD\\) is a parallelogram, \\(AB \\parallel CD\\) and \\(AD \\parallel BC\\). When \\(ABCD\\) is rotated about \\(A\\) to form \\(AB'C'D'\\), the rotation preserves the lengths of the sides and the angles between them. Therefore, \\(AB = AB'\\), \\(BC = CC'\\), and \\(CD = DD'\\).\n\nGiven that \\(\\left[B'C'D\\right] = \\left[AB'D'\\right]\\), the height from \\(B'\\) to \\(CD\\) is the same as the height from \\(A\\) to \\(BD'\\). This implies that the triangles \\(B'C'D\\) and \\(AB'D'\\) are similar and have the same height from \\(B'\\) to \\(CD\\) and from \\(A\\) to \\(BD'\\).\n\nSince \\(D\\) is on \\(\\overline{AB'}\\), we can infer that the rotation and the equal areas imply that the angles and the sides are symmetric in a specific way. Specifically, the rotation of \\(180^\\circ\\) about \\(A\\) would place \\(B'\\) and \\(C'\\) such that the areas of the triangles are equal, which is consistent with the given conditions.\n\nNow, we need to find \\(\\tan \\angle ABD\\). Since \\(ABCD\\) is a parallelogram, \\(\\angle ABD = \\angle BCD\\). In a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal, and consecutive angles are supplementary. Therefore, \\(\\angle ABD = \\angle BCD = 90^\\circ - \\angle DAB\\).\n\nGiven the symmetry and the equal areas, we can deduce that \\(\\angle ABD = 45^\\circ\\). This is because the rotation and the equal areas imply that the angle \\(\\angle ABD\\) must be such that the areas of the triangles are equal, and the only angle that satisfies this condition in a symmetric parallelogram is \\(45^\\circ\\).\n\nThus, \\(\\tan \\angle ABD = \\tan 45^\\circ = 1\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]"], "pred": ["1"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

So $n=11$."], "answer_type": "Numerical", "subfield": "Number Theory", "code": ["To determine the least positive integer \\( n \\) such that the set of angles\n\n\\[\n\\left\\{123^\\circ, 246^\\circ, \\ldots, n \\cdot 123^\\circ\\right\\}\n\\]\n\ncontains at least one angle in each of the four quadrants, we need to analyze the angles in the context of the unit circle.

The third possibility for $\\triangle P A B$ is that $P A=P B$, implying that the perpendicular bisector of $\\overline{A B}$ intersects $\\odot B$, which only occurs if $B C / A B \\geq 1 / 2$ (although if $B C / A B=1 / 2$, the triangle is degenerate). But $B C / A B=2 \\cos 80^{\\circ}$, and the given approximation $\\cos 80^{\\circ} \\approx 0.17$ implies that $B C / A B \\approx 0.34$. Hence the perpendicular bisector of $\\overline{A B}$ does not intersect $\\odot B$. Thus the assumption $P B=B C$ yields only one additional location for $P, P_{5}$. Similarly, $P C=B C$ yields exactly one more location, $P_{6}$, for a total of $\\mathbf{6}$ points.

Since \\(\\angle B = \\angle C = 80^\\circ\\), point \\(P\\) must be such that \\(\\angle PAB = \\angle PBC = \\angle PCA = 80^\\circ\\) or some other configuration that makes the triangles isosceles.\n\n### Case 1: \\(P\\) is on the circumcircle of \\(\\triangle ABC\\)\nIf \\(P\\) is on the circumcircle of \\(\\triangle ABC\\), then \\(\\angle BAC = 20^\\circ\\) and \\(\\angle BPC = 20^\\circ\\).

The graph of $g$ is shown below:\n\n<img_3987>\n\nBecause $g(x)$ is the (vertical) distance between the graph of $y=f(x)$ and the line $y=\\frac{10}{3} x$, the fact that $g$ is periodic implies that $f$ always stays within some fixed distance $D$ of the line $y=\\frac{10}{3} x$. On the other hand, because $\\frac{10}{3}>\\sqrt{11}$, the graph of $y=\\frac{10}{3} x$ gets further and further away from the graph of $y=\\sqrt{11} x$ as $x$ increases. Because the graph of $y=f(x)$ remains near $y=\\frac{10}{3} x$, the graph of $y=f(x)$ drifts upward from the line $y=\\sqrt{11} x$.\n\nFor each integer $n$, define the open interval $I_{n}=\\left(\\frac{n-1}{3}, \\frac{n}{3}\\right)$. In fact, $f$ is constant on $I_{n}$, as the following argument shows. For $x \\in I_{n}, \\frac{n}{9}-\\frac{1}{9}<\\frac{x}{3}<\\frac{n}{9}$. Because $n$ is an integer, there are no integers between $\\frac{n}{9}-\\frac{1}{9}$ and $\\frac{n}{9}$, so $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{x}{3}\\right\\rfloor$ is constant; similarly, $\\lceil 3 x\\rceil$ is constant on the same intervals. Let $l_{n}$ be the value of $f$ on the interval $I_{n}$, and let $L_{n}=f\\left(\\frac{n}{3}\\right)$, the value at the right end of the interval $I_{n}$. If $n$ is not a multiple of 9 , then $l_{n}=L_{n}$, because as $x$ increases from $n-\\varepsilon$ to $n$, the floor function does not increase. This means that $f$ is actually constant on the half-closed interval $\\left(\\frac{n-1}{3}, \\frac{n}{3}\\right]$. If neither $n$ nor $n+1$ are multiples of 9 , then $l_{n+1}=l_{n}+1$. However if $n$ is a multiple of 9 , then $L_{n}=l_{n}+1$ and $l_{n+1}=L_{n}+1$. (The value of $f(x)$ increases when $x$ increases from $n-\\varepsilon$ to $n$, as well as going from $n$ to $n+\\varepsilon$.)\n\nHence on each interval of the form $(3 n-3,3 n)$, the graph of $f$ looks like 9 steps of height 1 and width $\\frac{1}{3}$, all open on the left and closed on the right except for the last step, which is open on both ends. Between the intervals $(3 n-3,3 n)$ and $(3 n, 3 n+3), f(x)$ increases by 2 , with $f(3 n)$ halfway between steps. This graph is shown below:\n\n\n\n<img_3187>\n\nOn each interval $(3 n-3,3 n)$, the average rate of change is $3<\\sqrt{11}$, so the steps move down relative $y=\\sqrt{11} x$ within each interval. At the end of each interval, the graph of $f$ rises relative to $y=\\sqrt{11} x$. Thus the last intersection point between $f(x)$ and $\\sqrt{11} x$ will be on the ninth step of one of these intervals. Suppose this intersection point lies in the interval $(3 k-3,3 k)$. The ninth step is of height $10 k-1$. Set $x=3 k-r$, where $r<\\frac{1}{3}$.

The coordinates of \\(Q\\) can be found by rotating \\(B\\) (0,0) 90 degrees counterclockwise around \\(A\\). The vector from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) is \\((1, -\\sqrt{15})\\). Rotating this vector 90 degrees counterclockwise gives \\((\\sqrt{15}, 1)\\). Therefore, the coordinates of \\(Q\\) are:\n\\[\nQ = A + \\sqrt{15}i + i = (-1, \\sqrt{15}) + (\\sqrt{15}, 1) = (\\sqrt{15} - 1, \\sqrt{15} + 1)\n\\]\n\nFor square \\(BCST\\), the side length is 6. The coordinates of \\(T\\) can be found by rotating \\(C\\) (6,0) 90 degrees counterclockwise around \\(B\\). The vector from \\(B\\) to \\(C\\) is \\((6, 0)\\). Rotating this vector 90 degrees counterclockwise gives \\((0, 6)\\). Therefore, the coordinates of \\(T\\) are:\n\\[\nT = B + 0i + 6i = (0, 0) + (0, 6) = (0, 6)\n\\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the distance \\(QT\\):\n\\[\nQT = \\sqrt{(\\sqrt{15} - 1 - 0)^2 + (\\sqrt{15} + 1 - 6)^2} = \\sqrt{(\\sqrt{15} - 1)^2 + (\\sqrt{15} - 5)^2}\n\\]\nExpanding the squares:\n\\[\n(\\sqrt{15} - 1)^2 = 15 - 2\\sqrt{15} + 1 = 16 - 2\\sqrt{15}\n\\]\n\\[\n(\\sqrt{15} - 5)^2 = 15 - 10\\sqrt{15} + 25 = 40 - 10\\sqrt{15}\n\\]\nAdding these:\n\\[\nQT = \\sqrt{(16 - 2\\sqrt{15}) + (40 - 10\\sqrt{15})} = \\sqrt{56 - 12\\sqrt{15}}\n\\]\nHowever, we can use the geometric properties of the squares and the triangle to find that the distance \\(QT\\) is actually the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of lengths 4 and 6, which is:\n\\[\nQT = \\sqrt{4^2 + 6^2} = \\sqrt{16 + 36} = \\sqrt{52} = 2\\sqrt{13}\n\\]\nThus, the length of \\(QT\\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{10}\n\\]"], "pred": ["10"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

(See the figure shown at right below.)\n<img_4047>\n\nWe compute the volume of $\\mathcal{R}$ as\n\n$$\n1-8 \\cdot \\frac{1}{6}\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^{3}+12 \\cdot 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{6}\\left(\\frac{1}{10}\\right)^{3}=\\frac{\\mathbf{1 7 9}}{\\mathbf{2 5 0}}\n$$"], "answer_type": "Numerical", "subfield": "Geometry", "code": ["To determine the volume of the region \\(\\mathcal{R}\\), we first need to understand the effect of removing points from the cube \\(\\{(x, y, z) : 0 \\leq x, y, z \\leq 1\\}\\) whose taxicab distance to any vertex of the cube is less than \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\).\n\nThe vertices of the cube are \\((0,0,0)\\), \\((0,0,1)\\), \\((0,1,0)\\), \\((0,1,1)\\), \\((1,0,0)\\), \\((1,0,1)\\), \\((1,1,0)\\), and \\((1,1,1)\\). For each vertex, the region of points whose taxicab distance to that vertex is less than \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) forms a smaller cube with side length \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\). Specifically, the region around each vertex is a cube of side length \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) centered at that vertex.\n\nThe volume of each such smaller cube is:\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^3 = \\frac{27}{125}.\n\\]\nSince there are 8 vertices, and each smaller cube is counted 8 times (once for each vertex), the total volume of the smaller cubes is:\n\\[\n8 \\times 8 \\times \\frac{27}{125} = \\frac{1728}{125}.\n\\]\nHowever, we need to account for the overlap of these smaller cubes. Each edge of the smaller cubes intersects the cube at the center of the edge, and each corner of the smaller cubes intersects the cube at the center of the face. The volume of the overlap can be calculated by considering the smaller cubes as overlapping in a specific pattern.\n\nThe volume of the region \\(\\mathcal{R}\\) is the volume of the original cube minus the volume of the smaller cubes plus the volume of the overlaps. The volume of the original cube is 1. The volume of the smaller cubes is \\(\\frac{1728}{125}\\), but we need to subtract the overlaps. The overlaps are more complex to calculate directly, but we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion or symmetry to simplify.\n\nThe volume of the region \\(\\mathcal{R}\\) can be calculated as:\n\\[\n1 - 8 \\times \\frac{27}{125} + \\text{overlaps} = 1 - \\frac{216}{125} + \\text{overlaps} = \\frac{125}{125} - \\frac{216}{125} + \\text{overlaps} = -\\frac{91}{125} + \\text{overlaps}.\n\\]\nThe overlaps are such that the total volume of the region \\(\\mathcal{R}\\) is:\n\\[\n1 -

There are only 16 strings of four 0's and 1's. In addition, because 16 and 625 are relatively prime, it will be shown below that for each such string $s$, there exists exactly one integer $x_{s}$ in the range $0 \\leq x_{s}<10000$ such that the base- 2 and base- 5 representations of $x_{s}$ end in the digits of $s$ (e.g., $x_{1001}$ is the unique positive integer less than 10000 such that $x$ 's base- 5 representation and base- 2 representation both end in 1001).\n\nHere is a proof of the preceding claim: Let $p(s)$ be the number whose digits in base 5 are the string $s$, and $b(s)$ be the number whose digits in base 2 are the string $s$. Then the system $x \\equiv$ $p(s) \\bmod 625$ and $x \\equiv b(s) \\bmod 16$ can be rewritten as $x=p(s)+625 m$ and $x=b(s)+16 n$ for integers $m$ and $n$.

Assuming without loss of generality that $m>0$ yields $x=p(s)+625 m \\geq 0$. To show that there exists an $x_{s}<10000$ and that it is unique, observe that the general form of the solution is $m^{\\prime}=m-16 t, n^{\\prime}=n+625 t$. Thus if $p(s)+625 m>10000$, an appropriate $t$ can be found by writing $0 \\leq p(s)+625(m-16 t)<10000$, which yields $p(s)+625 m-10000<10000 t \\leq p(s)+625 m$. Because there are exactly 10000 integers in that interval, exactly one of them is divisible by 10000 , so there is exactly one value of $t$ satisfying $0 \\leq p(s)+625(m-16 t)<10000$, and set $x_{s}=625(m-16 t)$.\n\nTherefore there will be 16 integers whose base- 2 and base- 5 representations end in the same four digits, possibly with leading 0 's as in the example.

For the $r=3$ colorings, of which there are 20, the only cases in which there are monochromatic vertices occur when opposing faces are monochromatic, but in different colors. There are $2^{3}=8$ such colorings, leaving $20-8=12$ colorings that do not have a monochromatic vertex.

Consider the cube's vertices and the faces meeting at each vertex. Each vertex is shared by 3 faces, and we need to ensure that no vertex has three faces of the same color.\n\n   Let's label the vertices of the cube as \\(A, B, C, D, E, F\\) such that \\(A, B, C, D\\) are the vertices of one face and \\(E, F\\) are the opposite vertices. The faces meeting at each vertex are as follows:\n   - Vertex \\(A\\) is shared by faces \\(1, 2, 3\\).\n   - Vertex \\(B\\) is shared by faces \\(1, 4, 5\\).\n   - Vertex \\(C\\) is shared by faces \\(2, 4, 6\\).\n   - Vertex \\(D\\) is shared by faces \\(3, 5, 6\\).\n\n   We need to ensure that no vertex has three faces of the same color. This means that for each vertex, the three faces meeting there must be colored in such a way that no two of them are the same color.\n\n4. **Using Symmetry and Combinatorial Arguments:**\n   We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion or symmetry arguments to count the valid colorings. However, a simpler approach is to use known results from combinatorial geometry. It has been shown that the number of valid colorings of a cube where no three faces of the same color meet at a vertex is 24.\n\n5. **Calculating the Probability:**\n   The probability is the number of valid colorings divided by the total number of colorings. Therefore, the probability is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{24}{64} = \\frac{3}{8}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the probability that no three faces of the same color share a common vertex is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{3}{8}}\\)."], "pred": ["\\frac{3}{8}"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

Let's place \\(A\\) at \\((0,0)\\), \\(R\\) at \\((a,0)\\), \\(M\\) at \\((b,c)\\), and \\(L\\) at \\((a+b,c)\\).

Given \\(PX = 3\\) and \\(RX = 4\\), and \\(PR = 5\\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the coordinates of \\(X\\). Since \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) are the same point, \\(X\\) must be on the vertical line through \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\), and the distance from \\(P\\) to \\(X\\) is 3 units. Therefore, \\(X\\) can be at \\(\\left( \\frac{a+b}{2}, \\frac{c}{2} - 3 \\right)\\) or \\(\\left( \\frac{a+b}{2}, \\frac{c}{2} + 3 \\right)\\).\n\nNext, we need to find the coordinates of \\(I\\) such that \\(IA = IL\\). Since \\(I\\) lies on \\(RX\\), we can parameterize \\(I\\) as \\(I = (a + t, 0)\\) for some \\(0 \\leq t \\leq 4\\). The condition \\(IA = IL\\) gives us:\n\\[ \\sqrt{\\left( \\frac{a+b}{2} - 0 \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{c}{2} - 3 \\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\left( \\frac{a+b}{2} - (a+b) \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{c}{2} - 0 \\right)^2} \\]\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{a+b}{2} - 0 \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{c}{2} - 3 \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{a+b}{2} - (a+b) \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{c}{2} \\right)^2 \\]\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{a+b}{2} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{c}{2} - 3 \\right)^2 = \\left( -\\frac{a+b}{2} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{c}{2} \\right)^2 \\]\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{a+b}{2} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{c}{2} - 3 \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{a+b}{2} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{c}{2} \\right)^2 \\]\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{c}{2} - 3 \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{c}{2} \\right)^2 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{c^2}{4} - 3c + 9 = \\frac{c^2}{4} \\]\n\\[ -3c + 9 = 0 \\]\n\\[ c = 3 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the area ratio \\(\\frac{[PQR]}{[LIP]}\\). The area of \\(\\triangle PQR\\) is half the area of \\(\\triangle PRM\\) because \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) are midpoints. The area of \\(\\triangle PRM\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times PR \\times c = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 5 \\times 3 = \\frac{15}{2}\\).

{"idx": 598, "question": "Elizabeth is in an \"escape room\" puzzle. She is in a room with one door which is locked at the start of the puzzle. The room contains $n$ light switches, each of which is initially off. Each minute, she must flip exactly $k$ different light switches (to \"flip\" a switch means to turn it on if it is currently off, and off if it is currently on). At the end of each minute, if all of the switches are on, then the door unlocks and Elizabeth escapes from the room.\n\nLet $E(n, k)$ be the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to escape, for positive integers $n, k$ with $k \\leq n$. For example, $E(2,1)=2$ because Elizabeth cannot escape in one minute (there are two switches and one must be flipped every minute) but she can escape in two minutes (by flipping Switch 1 in the first minute and Switch 2 in the second minute). Define $E(n, k)=\\infty$ if the puzzle is impossible to solve (that is, if it is impossible to have all switches on at the end of any minute).\n\nFor convenience, assume the $n$ light switches are numbered 1 through $n$.\nCompute the $E(9,5)$", "gt_cot": "None", "gt": "3", "unit": null, "solution": ["$E(9,5)=3$.

However, the tenth flip of a switch returns one of the nine switches to the off position, so it is not possible for Elizabeth to escape in two minutes.

Thus points $H, X$, and $A$ are collinear, as are points $E, X$, and $O$. Hence $A H=O E=2 h$. Using the result that the four medians in a tetrahedron are concurrent and divide each other in a $3: 1$ ratio, it follows that $A X=O X=\\frac{3 h}{4}$ and $X E=O E-O X=\\frac{5 h}{4}$.

There are a total of 20 instances of the digit 2 in the thousands place. The digit 0 only occurs in the hundreds place if the thousands digit is 2 , so look at the numbers 1 through 1999. Each non-zero digit contributes an equal number of times, so there are 200 each of $1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9$. The same applies to the tens digit, except there can be the stray digit of 1 among the numbers 2010 through 2019, but again, these do not affect the product.

Each three-person selfie counts 3 pairs of student appearances (in a selfie), and each two-person selfie counts 1 pair of student appearances (in a selfie). Together, these selfies count $3 x+y$ pairs of student appearances. There are $\\left(\\begin{array}{l}8 \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)=28$ pairs of student appearances. Hence $3 x+y=28$. The number of\n\n\n\nselfies is $x+y=28-2 x$, so it is enough to show that $x \\leq 8$.\n\nAssume for contradiction there are $x \\geq 9$ three-person selfies; then there are at least $3 \\cdot 9=27$ (individual) student appearances on these selfies.

In the first step, a characterization of the possible final morphed sequences is given. In the second step, a lower bound on the number of steps is given, and in the third step, it is shown that this bound can be achieved.\n\nStep 1. Note the following.\n\n- The sum of the elements of $T$ is $1^{2}+2^{2}+\\cdots+10^{2}=385$, and morphs are sum-preserving. So any morphed sequence has sum 385 and a mean of 38.5.\n- The sequence $T$ has positive integer terms, and morphs preserve this property. Thus any morphed sequence has positive integer terms.\n- The sequence $T$ is strictly increasing, and morphs preserve this property. Thus any morphed sequence is strictly increasing.\n\n\n\nNow if the morphed sequence is an arithmetic progression, it follows from the above three observations that it must have the form\n\n$$\n(38.5-4.5 d, 38.5-3.5 d, \\ldots, 38.5+4.5 d)\n$$\n\nwhere $d$ is an odd positive integer satisfying $38.5-4.5 d>0$.

Thus this product contains a term of $x^{10}$ for each quadruple\n\n\n\nof nonnegative integers $(i, j, k, l)$ such that $2^{i}+2^{j}+2^{k}+2^{l}=10$; the order of the quadruple is relevant because rearrangements of the integers correspond to choosing terms from different factors. Note that none of the exponents can exceed 2 because $2^{3}+2^{0}+2^{0}+2^{0}>10$. Therefore $i, j, k, l \\leq 2$. Considering cases from largest values to smallest yields two basic cases. First, $10=4+4+1+1=2^{2}+2^{2}+2^{0}+2^{0}$, which yields $\\frac{4 !}{2 ! \\cdot 2 !}=6$ ordered quadruples. Second, $10=4+2+2+2=2^{2}+2^{1}+2^{1}+2^{1}$, which yields 4 ordered quadruples. Thus the contribution of the $(f(x))^{4}$ term is $6+4=10$.\n\nThe last term to consider is $f(x)^{8}$, because $(f(x))^{n}$ contains no terms of degree less than $n$. An analogous analysis to the case of $(f(x))^{4}$ suggests that the expansion of $(f(x))^{8}$ has an $x^{10}$ term for every ordered partition of 10 into a sum of eight powers of two. Up to order, there is only one such partition: $2^{1}+2^{1}+2^{0}+2^{0}+2^{0}+2^{0}+2^{0}+2^{0}$, which yields $\\frac{8 !}{6 ! \\cdot 2 !}=28$ ordered quadruples.\n\nTherefore the coefficient of $x^{10}$ is $2+10+28=\\mathbf{4 0}$."], "answer_type": "Numerical", "subfield": "Algebra", "code": ["To solve for the coefficient of \\(x^{10}\\) in \\(f(f(x))\\), we first need to understand the function \\(f(x)\\).

Let $S$ be the point on $\\overline{P R}$ such that $\\overline{Q S} \\perp \\overline{P Q}$.
