Let's denote the general term in the expansion as:\n\n\\[\nT_k = \\binom{6}{k} (2x^3)^{6-k} \\left(-\\frac{1}{x}\\right)^k\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the general term, we get:\n\n\\[\nT_k = \\binom{6}{k} 2^{6-k} x^{3(6-k)} \\left(-1\\right)^k x^{-k} = \\binom{6}{k} 2^{6-k} (-1)^k x^{18-4k}\n\\]\n\nWe want the exponent of $x$ to be 2, so we set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n18 - 4k = 2\n\\]\n\nSolving for $k$:\n\n\\[\n18 - 2 = 4k \\implies 16 = 4k \\implies k = 4\n\\]\n\nNow, we substitute $k = 4$ back into the general term to find the coefficient:\n\n\\[\nT_4 = \\binom{6}{4} 2^{6-4} (-1)^4 x^{18-4(4)} = \\binom{6}{4} 2^2 x^2 = \\binom{6}{4} 4 x^2\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of the $x^2$ term is:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{4} 4 = \\frac{6!}{4!(6-4)!} \\cdot 4 = \\frac{6 \\cdot 5}{2 \\cdot 1} \\cdot 4 = 15 \\cdot 4 = 60\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of the $x^2$ term is $\\boxed{60}$."], "pred": ["60"], "report": [null], "score": [true]}

Let's break it down step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Absolute Value Expression\nThe function \\(f(x)\\) involves an absolute value, which means we need to consider two cases based on the sign of the expression inside the absolute value: \\(x^2 - ax + 1\\).\n\n#### Case 1: \\(x^2 - ax + 1 \\geq 0\\)\nIn this case, \\(|x^2 - ax + 1| = x^2 - ax + 1\\).

Since Makawee scored 6 points more than Erica, Makawee's score would be \\( E + 6 \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the new total sum with Erica and Makawee included**: The new total sum should be equal to the original sum plus the sum of Erica's and Makawee's scores.\n\n4. **Set up an equation based on the condition that the overall average does not change**: The average of the original 24 scores is equal to the average of the new 26 scores.

There are 20 faces, and for each face, there are 2 vertices that can be chosen as \\(Q\\) and \\(R\\). However, since \\(Q\\) and \\(R\\) are distinct, we need to choose 2 out of the 12 vertices, and then choose 2 out of the 5 vertices in each face. This gives us \\(20 \\times \\binom{5}{2} = 20 \\times 10 = 200\\) ways to choose \\(Q\\) and \\(R\\).\n- For \\(d(R,S) = 3\\), \\(R\\) and \\(S\\) must be connected by a path of length 3. This means \\(R\\) and \\(S\\) must be connected by an edge, and there are 30 edges in the icosahedron. However, since \\(R\\) is already chosen, there are 11 remaining vertices to choose from for \\(S\\). This gives us \\(30 \\times 11 = 330\\) ways to choose \\(S\\).\n\nSo, the total number of ways for Case 1 is \\(200 \\times 330 = 66000\\).\n\n**Case 2: \\(d(Q,R) = 3\\) and \\(d(R,S) = 2\\)**\n\n- For \\(d(Q,R) = 3\\), \\(Q\\) and \\(R\\) must be connected by a path of length 3. This means \\(Q\\) and \\(R\\) must be connected by an edge, and there are 30 edges in the icosahedron. However, since \\(Q\\) is already chosen, there are 11 remaining vertices to choose from for \\(R\\). This gives us \\(30 \\times 11 = 330\\) ways to choose \\(R\\).\n- For \\(d(R,S) = 2\\), \\(R\\) and \\(S\\) must share a common face. There are 20 faces, and for each face, there are 2 vertices that can be chosen as \\(R\\) and \\(S\\). However, since \\(R\\) is already chosen, there are 11 remaining vertices to choose from for \\(S\\). This gives us \\(20 \\times \\binom{5}{2} = 20 \\times 10 = 200\\) ways to choose \\(S\\).\n\nSo, the total number of ways for Case 2 is \\(330 \\times 200 = 66000\\).\n\nAdding the number of ways for both cases, we get \\(66000 + 66000 = 132000\\).\n\n3. **Probability calculation**: The probability that \\(d(Q,R) > d(R,S)\\) is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes. Therefore, the probability is \\(\\frac{132000}{220 \\times 220} = \\frac{132000}{48400} = \\frac{33}{11} = \\frac{3}{1}\\).\n\nSo, the probability that \\(d(Q,R) > d(R,S)\\) is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}\\)."], "pred": ["\\frac{1}{2}"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

The sum of the lengths of all 12 edges of P is 13, the sum of the areas of all 6 faces of P is $\\frac{11}{2}$, and the volume of P is $\\frac12$. What is the length of the longest interior diagonal connecting two vertices of P?", "gt_cot": "None", "gt": "\\frac{9}{4}", "answer": "$\\frac94$", "code": ["To find the length of the longest interior diagonal of the rectangular box P, we need to determine the edge lengths a, b, and c. We are given the following information:\n\n1. The sum of the lengths of all 12 edges of P is 13.\n2. The sum of the areas of all 6 faces of P is $\\frac{11}{2}$.\n3. The volume of P is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nLet's start by using the information about the sum of the lengths of the edges. Since a rectangular box has 12 edges, and each edge length appears 4 times in the sum, we can write:\n\n\\[4(a + b + c) = 13\\]\n\nNext, we use the information about the sum of the areas of the faces. A rectangular box has 6 faces, and each face is a rectangle with area equal to the product of two edge lengths. Therefore, the sum of the areas of the faces is:\n\n\\[2(ab + bc + ca) = \\frac{11}{2}\\]\n\nFinally, we use the information about the volume of the box. The volume of a rectangular box is given by the product of its edge lengths:\n\n\\[abc = \\frac{1}{2}\\]\n\nNow we have a system of three equations:\n\n1. \\(4(a + b + c) = 13\\)\n2. \\(2(ab + bc + ca) = \\frac{11}{2}\\)\n3. \\(abc = \\frac{1}{2}\\)\n\nWe can solve this system step by step.

What is the area of the triangle?", "gt_cot": "None", "gt": "15\\sqrt{3}", "answer": "$15\\sqrt{3}$", "code": ["To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the side lengths**: Since the side lengths are in arithmetic progression and the shortest side is 6, let's denote the side lengths as \\(6\\), \\(6 + d\\), and \\(6 + 2d\\), where \\(d\\) is the common difference.\n\n2. **Use the Law of Cosines**: Given that one of the interior angles is \\(120^\\circ\\), we can use the Law of Cosines to relate the side lengths and the angle. The Law of Cosines states:\n   \\[\n   c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cos(C)\n   \\]\n   where \\(C\\) is the angle opposite side \\(c\\). In our case, \\(C = 120^\\circ\\), so \\(\\cos(120^\\circ) = -\\frac{1}{2}\\). Let's assume the side opposite the \\(120^\\circ\\) angle is \\(c\\), and the other two sides are \\(a = 6\\) and \\(b = 6 + d\\). Then:\n   \\[\n   c^2 = 6^2 + (6 + d)^2 - 2 \\cdot 6 \\cdot (6 + d) \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this equation:\n   \\[\n   c^2 = 36 + (6 + d)^2 + 6(6 + d)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   c^2 = 36 + 36 + 12d + d^2 + 36 + 6d\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   c^2 = 108 + 18d + d^2\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\(d\\)**: We need to find the value of \\(d\\) that satisfies the equation. However, we can also use the fact that the triangle is a right triangle with a \\(120^\\circ\\) angle, which means the triangle is a right triangle with the right angle opposite the shortest side. This implies that the side lengths must satisfy the Pythagorean theorem. Let's assume the side opposite the \\(120^\\circ\\) angle is the hypotenuse, and the other two sides are the legs. Then:\n   \\[\n   (6 + d)^2 + 6^2 = (6 + 2d)^2\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this equation:\n   \\[\n   36 + 12d + d^2 + 36 = 36 + 24d + 4d^2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   72 + 12d + d^2 = 36 + 24d + 4d^2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   36 = 3d^2 + 12d\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   3d^2 + 12d - 36 = 0\n   \\]\n   Dividing by 3:\n   \\[\n   d^2 + 4d - 12 = 0\n   \\]\n   Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \\(d = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\):\n   \\[\n   d = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 + 48}}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   d = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{64}}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   d = \\frac{-4 \\pm 8}{2}\n   \\]\n   This gives us two solutions: \\(d = 2\\) and \\(d = -6\\). Since \\(d\\) represents a length, it must be positive, so \\(d = 2\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the area**: Now that we have the side lengths, we can calculate the area of the triangle. The area \\(A\\) of a triangle can be calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   A = \\frac{1}{2}ab \\sin(C)\n   \\]\n   where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are two sides and \\(C\\) is the included angle.

So:\n   \\[\n   A = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 6 \\cdot 8 \\cdot \\sin(120^\\circ)\n   \\]\n   Since \\(\\sin(120^\\circ) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\):\n   \\[\n   A = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 6 \\cdot 8 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   A = 12\\sqrt{3}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the area of the triangle is \\(\\boxed{12\\sqrt{3}}\\)."], "pred": ["12\\sqrt{3}"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}
