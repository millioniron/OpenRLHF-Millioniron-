Let's denote the probability that Flora will eventually land at position \\( k \\) as \\( P(k) \\).\n\nFirst, note that Flora starts at position 0. The probability that she will eventually land at 10 is \\( P(10) \\). We can express \\( P(k) \\) in terms of the probabilities of her reaching the positions 1, 2, 3, ..., 9 from position 0. Specifically, we have:\n\\[ P(10) = \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} P(10-m) \\cdot \\frac{1}{2^m} \\]\nThis equation states that the probability of Flora landing at 10 is the sum of the probabilities of her landing at 10 minus each possible jump distance \\( m \\) (from 1 to 9), each multiplied by the probability of making that jump and then landing at 10 from the resulting position.\n\nTo solve this, we need to find a pattern or a closed form for \\( P(k) \\).

However, since we have three values, we need to use a different approach.\n\nFirst, let's consider the values 6, 10, and 15. We can express any value that is a multiple of 6 as a combination of 6 and 15 (since 15 is a multiple of 6). Similarly, any value that is a multiple of 10 can be expressed as a combination of 10 and 15. Therefore, we need to find the largest value that cannot be expressed as a combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n\nWe can start by checking the values that are not multiples of 6 or 10. The smallest value that is not a multiple of 6 or 10 is 11. We can check if 11 can be expressed as a combination of 6, 10, and 15. Since 11 is less than 15, it cannot be expressed as a combination of 15. Therefore, 11 is a candidate for the largest value that cannot be expressed as a combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n\nNext, we need to check if there is a larger value that cannot be expressed as a combination of 6, 10, and 15. We can do this by checking the values that are multiples of 6 or 10. The next value that is not a multiple of 6 or 10 is 17. We can check if 17 can be expressed as a combination of 6, 10, and 15. Since 17 is greater than 15, it can be expressed as a combination of 15 and 2 (which is not a valid combination since we are only using 6, 10, and 15). Therefore, 17 is not a candidate for the largest value that cannot be expressed as a combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n\nWe can continue this process to find the largest value that cannot be expressed as a combination of 6, 10, and 15. The next value that is not a multiple of 6 or 10 is 23. We can check if 23 can be expressed as a combination of 6, 10, and 15. Since 23 is greater than 15, it can be expressed as a combination of 15 and 8 (which is not a valid combination since we are only using 6, 10, and 15). Therefore, 23 is not a candidate for the largest value that cannot be expressed as a combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n\nWe can continue this process until we find the largest value that cannot be expressed as a combination of 6, 10, and 15.
